Breadcrumbs. Some just like the idea of a new trail, nothing wrong with that, any excuse to walk the dog is a good excuse.

There be Mockinjays in those woods.

I like magpies, they collect shiny things and take them to their friends. People have even trained them to steal.

1 for sorrow, 2 for joy, 3 for a girl and 4 for a boy, 5 for silver, 6 for gold, 7 for a secret never to be told.

It's not a leak. It's an official announcement.
https://robertsspaceindustries.com/spectrum/community/SC/forum/1/thread/star-citizen-alpha-3-21-update-1

Patch 3.21 has been released to a PTU. It's a patch that will connect to the game in a different way to what we've had before.

Yes, it may take a lot of cooking. But at least that technology they have been talking about is in a state to let players test it.. so that's new.

They talk about a plan - Don't believe them!
They show progress on the plan - Don't believe them!
They put it in the game build and internally test it - Don't believe them!
They let players test it - Don't believe them!

OK fine... you do you. Bah humbug.

I think they wanted to get into players hands to test it because they know it's the base for the next major content drop yet it's brand new and may take a while to stabilise. Seen it before.

We are allowed to ask why. It's kinda an individual rights thing.

I think the why is because they have a lot of stages to test and they want to get started in the hope it's all done and stable, ready for a content drop for the holidays. But that's just my 2 cents. Someone might mock me and think I'm naive. I might shake my head and think some are just too negative and jaded. We could say it about any game, any politicians promise. If that approach to life gets you through. OK.

Some of us can manage a little disappointment if we had held out a little hope and it didn't happen. Even immersing yourself in the technicality of it has some extrinsic value. Maybe the tide is turning, maybe it's not. A little paddle never hurt anyone, not really. I like surprises but I don't cry myself to sleep if they don't come.

But it is new, it will get the Youtubers fired up. No denying that. Already seen it. The salty became sweet for a while. I always like to see Montoya. He'll be a definite show. They make greetings cards out of a picture of tiny faces pressed against a Victorian shoppe in the snow, no-one hangs a picture of the grumpy old kicked dog hiding in his hole. There'll be some faces at the window, despite the growling.

Why do they put pictures of scruffy half starved little mites against a frozen window of a pie shoppe on holiday cards? I think it's because for a moment we can feel warm thinking that if we were there, we'd give them a hot pie to warm their little bellies. We're inside, we only have to open the door. I hope I would, and that's the thing about hope it's better than free. you can give as much to as many as you like, whenever you like, yet you always have more than enough left over for yourself if you don't let someone take it away from you.

It can and it can't. The Replication Layer can't stop the client disconnect happening if it's between the client and the RL, but it can help stop you losing progress because when you log back in or reconnect everything persisted just where you left it, including you (the player avatar)... depending on how long it takes you to log back in. Someone might come along and pinch your stuff. Your ship might have been stored.. as far as the RL is concerned you alt-F4'd. If you're not connected to the RL, it doesn't know you got a client side 30K notification.

Don't flatter yourself, but thanks for the admission that you find it hard to follow a reasoned argument. However you still miss those nuances. I'm sorry but the word count limit doesn't allow me to keep spelling it out letter by letter.

You're doing it again - you're equating 'late because it's not out and final by their hoped or planned estimate' - with failed. It's not failed, it's late. Failed is missing from a final game release. There has not been a final game release Comprende? Wait - I'll help since you brought up 'defintions'

Failed
1.(of an undertaking or a relationship) not achieving its end or not lasting; unsuccessful. "a failed coup attempt"
2.(of a mechanism) not functioning properly. "an aircraft with a failed engine"

Late
/leÉªt/
adjective
1. doing something or taking place after the expected, proper, or usual time. "his late arrival"
Similar: behind time, behind schedule, not on time, unpunctual, tardy, running late, overdue, delayed.

adverb
1. after the expected, proper, or usual time. "she arrived late"
Similar: behind schedule, behind time

No-one, not even Chris will argue that the game isn't taking longer than expected and by definition (as you say) that means it is late by their previous estimates - I'll give you that. Failed, is completely different. We can discuss the reasons why it is late, but we can't discuss why it failed because it hasn't, they are still working on all of it. It's not a strawman, it's a plain fact.
"My argument is "why have they been so wrong, so consistently, about their ability to get it done in the timelines they themselves put forward" - and it's one you still haven't engaged with, because you keep attempting to change the subject. Why is that?"

There you go, we can discuss that. Thing is, I have engaged with it.
"It's a simplistic notion that just because they talk about something it will arrive tomorrow. There are such things as technical dependencies, unforeseen events and budgetary restrictions."

Too many wordy made all a bit confusing? Eyes go googly? OK I'll break it down:

Technical Dependencies - these are things you need to make things go. If you've never made those things that make things go before, you can only give an estimate about how long it will take to make them. Hence my talking about the difference between Game Design and Game Building. Sorry, promised to keep it simple. My bad.

Some games are built with the same things you built a game with before, so you if you know how long it took before and you make a game with the same tools, very same - you can make a good guess about how long the next game will take to make. Skyrim V and Starfield are very samey gamey, because they made them with same tools! Yay! Getting it now?

Game Design. This is a brand new game! Never made one like it before! It's made with shiny new tools you had to make yourself! First you had to find some clever boys and girls, tell them what you want to make, then they make the tools, they might not get it exactly right the first try but that's OK, and once they've made the tools you can use those to make YOUR GAME! Guessing how long it takes to make tools is hard, really really hard, because even clever girls and boys have to do a real lot of head-scratchy thinking about it. Especially when you need a lot of tools! Knowing which tools you need to make something you've never made before is really really hard. Boo hoo. Sad face.

You know what's even harder? Starting to make your game even while your friends are still making the tools! You don't know how long they will take to make the tools, you have to think about - what can I do while I'm waiting for Craigs tool! and Jonathans tool! and.. and.. Sarah's tool! Oh no!

Here's another of those confusing words. Unforeseen.
It means you didn't know it was gonna happen! Like when some of your friends who've been helping you are sick and away from the playhouse, or or.. they go on holidays! Have ickle babies! Aww!

Or they go away to go play with other friends. Sad face.

Oh No! Now how long will it take to make my game? It'll never be finished on time for my friends party! He'll be very upset!

Sometimes everybody gets sick and we ALL have to move out of the playhouse! Yikes!

We need more friends to help us make our game! but we can't find anymore friends right now, we've got lots of sweets and candies, but no-one wants to play!

Oh wait, we got some new friends but we haven't got enough space, we'll all have to move to a new playhouse, a bigger one! That'll be fun!
Except when he specifically told everyone that even if funding dried up tomorrow, they'd still be able to deliver the game they had sold. Or did you conveniently forget that fact? Here's the quote, in case you did:

"We keep a healthy cash reserve so that if funding stopped tomorrow we would still be able to deliver Star Citizen (not quite to the current level of ambition, but well above what was planned in Oct 2012)."

This just goes to show your lack of critical thinking. That post was from 2014! How many offices did they have? How many staff did they have? How many do they have now?

50 jellybeans divided by 10 playmates, we each get 5 jellybeans! Yay!

Oh no we got more friends, a lot more! Now we have 100 friends!

Only 50 jellybeans! We only get half a jellybean each! Very very sad face!

Oh wait.. that's nice Mummy and Daddy have been giving us more jellybeans all along.. Yay! Everybody still gets 5 jellybeans!

Don't you think they have to keep adding to that reserve, as well as increasing expenses? Where does that come from? Have you actually read their yearly financial statements?

When you grab a quote do you actually read it? The bit in the brackets - (not quite to the current level of ambition, but well above what was planned in Oct 2012). Hmm I wonder what 'not quite the current level of mambition means'? Does it mean 'dumbed down', maybe? Or maybe 'Some things missing?'

It wouldn't take much to go above what was planned in 2012 from the perspective of technical game design, THEY'VE ALREADY SURPASSED IT - as I said. It's not me assuming they haven't done any work on things they haven't shown, I know they have. But some won't be convinced because - "Unless I see it in the game neeeooowww it doesn't exist!" Huh!, I think maybe you're one of them. Fairly sure about it.
"What an inherently stupid idea, stop funding the project and it will get us the whole 100 star systems promised game sooner... and Squadron 42!"

"Well, considering that idea comes directly from Chris Roberts himself, you tell me!"

Are you suggesting Chris is telling everyone to stop contributing to the game? He's gone on social media and said - Don't give any more money! Anybody! No, you don't mean that, you probably had a memory tucked away about him saying - If someone thinks they contributed enough then don't contribute anymore, we're good. But there we go again, it's the same old talky-points arguments. It's only the deluded whales keeping the project afloat! It's not all those newcomers, can't be! Just can't be.

We're done. I can't take you seriously. You seem to have even less grasp of what this project is about, what it's purpose and history is than some who arrived last month.

Sorry, teacher says - you failed!

If there is no break between you and the RL, sure you can reconnect as a replacement DGS is spun up, but if there is a break you'll still see the 30K notification because it's a client side error. We'll see them a LOT less often, but they will still happen. Bad WiFi, bad internet - you know.

If a DGS goes down your game client will keep running as it's connected to the Replication Layer but nothing in the game will respond until you're reconnected to a DGS. The RL doesn't simulate the game world, it just keeps hold of the authority over your game client to keep it running.

Not exactly. Sorry to say.

30K's are a game client notification of game service authority disconnect. Yes, a DGS crash can cause a 30K, but there are other causes.

If there is a network disconnect anywhere between the Replication Layer and your game client for more than a specified period you'll still see a 30K notification.

But yeah, no more 'crash incoming!'

Struggling to understand what you mean here, are you using 'instance' in place of 'Shard'?

Speaking more broadly:

There will be multiple instances of the whole game universe called Shards. There will only be one version of a game location per shard, but each game location will exist on all shards. There won't be copies of game locations per Dedicated Game Server in a shard. Shard 1 will only have one Stanton system and one Pyro system. Shard 2 will have it's own Stanton and Pyro... and so on.

Each shard will have as many meshed servers as it requires per the player population in that shard. Dedicated Game Servers are only spun up for locations where the players are, there won't be empty DGS's spun up, many thousands of players per shard who can all interact via meshed DGS's on that shard. Obviously those parts of the game universe won't have anything happening in them if they aren't spun up on a DGS and that's why the backend simulation is running to make the whole game universe dynamically change over time even in places where there are no players.

As they progress toward Dynamic Server Meshing the number of shards can be reduced but real world signal travel time has some bearing on that. Dynamic Server Meshing is about a more cost efficient use of player servers which will become more population driven rather than game location driven, DSM reduces the need to spin up a game location on a Dedicated Game Server just because one player is present, rather than a location having a fixed game world boundary that boundary can expand or contract according to where the players are.

Taking the extreme example of 1 player in a shard:
If a player is in Stanton then there is a DGS spun up with the Stanton system it has static boundaries, it can only load the Stanton system. That is Static Server Meshing.

If the player wants to go to the Pyro system then another DGS has to be spun up that has Pyro on it so the player can move DGS to DGS to get to Pyro. The Stanton server is then spun down. You need to rent time on two DGS's.

With Dynamic Server Meshing the DGS holding Stanton can have it's boundaries dynamically extended to load Pyro onto the same server, the player goes to Pyro while on the same server. Stanton is then streamed out of that DGS using Server Object Container Streaming. You only need to rent time on one DGS with Dynamic Server Meshing for that player.

Quantum runs a virtual copy for each shard (some things will be copied across shards such as commodity prices etc) it's purpose is to simulate the places where players aren't. Quantum and the vNPC system are to put NPC's and the economy into each shard. Quantum and vNPC's won't be shard hopping at the granular level where players can encounter it directly.

So.. yes there will be thousands of players per shard once Static and Dynamic Server Meshing is in, as to whether there will ever be only one shard for all players that is dependent on solutions to real world signal travel time, so yes it's unlikely in the medium term, even with Dynamic Server Meshing it will remain regional shards for a good while yet. Dynamic Server Meshing is not an answer to signal travel time delay, it is the answer to making server meshing more cost efficient per player. If they can simulate a maximum of 1 million vNPC's on a server running the whole universe and it supplied all shards simultaneously with unique vNPC's then you'd have to divide the number of vNPC's by the number of running shards, it's easier to run 1 million vNPC's per shard since it just requires 1 running simulation server per shard. Players on one shard will not encounter vNPC's on another shard at all just like players on one shard can't encounter players on another shard. If there are 10 shards and 1 million vNPC's shared over all shards then 900,000 vNPC's are being simulated for players that they would never see on their shard.

UE doesn't come with persistence, so far Bethesda's Creation Engine and Starengine are the only major ones that support that feature
Creation Engine 2 doesn't come with any more Persistence than Skyrim V or any other game by Bethesda. Creation Engine, old or new, cannot make un-modded multiplayer games. The persistence comes from the game save stored locally on your hard drive, it is not shared persistence.

Creation Engine 2 uses cell technology just like other Bethesda games to put game content into an area. Imagine a honeycomb grid, the player walks on this grid. The honeycomb cell the player is in is populated by game content via RAM loading, the cells around the cell the player is in are loaded with lower LOD content and that lower LOD content doesn't get thread priority for physics they don't even rig the 3D meshes for characters at the lower LOD's only the top level LOD's are rigged for animation. You can see this in Skyrim V most notably with giants, windmills and waterfalls, they are static and un-animated until you are in the cell they occupy once the LOD's are swapped out. If Todd Howard knew that Creation Engine 2 had changed the way it loaded RAM he would be shouting it from the rooftops because he knows there is an army of modders out there who know the Creation Engine capabilities very well and they would be overjoyed to hear it.

RAM loading takes time so this process is prone to 'popping in' of game assets - this is why they don't have low level high speed over-ground traversal in Starfield, it's why you have an in-engine animated loading screen for flight to ground, once the single POV landing sequence is complete your ship is a static object just like a building or a dungeon. The space flight / space combat will (is seen to be) very basic compared to other games of the type. Starfield has fast travel just like other Bethesda games, it's just hidden behind the non-interactable loading animation.

This cell loading is also why they make single-player games because you can only top LOD load one cell the player is in, any cell another player is in will have less / lower LOD objects in it from the players point of view. The player thinks he is crouching in thick bush and can't be seen, meanwhile the other player sees no bushes around other players, only his own cells bushes. Star Citizen and Squadron 42 use Object Container Streaming for RAM loading, so they don't have this issue or limitations. StarEngine has the limitation that objects are less dense overall, but that is what Server Meshing is planned to fix.

UE5 looks nice but it has limitations, the sort of limitations that make it unusable for a Star Citizen type game. Nanite has a list of things it doesn't support, such as transparency / translucency (there is no light transport through any object rendered via Nanite) and there is no stereoscopic VR capability for Nanite rendered objects. It doesn't support complex UV's or 3D mesh rigging the way StarEngine does and you can only use one type of material preset - solid object.

The easiest way (in my view) to understand what Nanite is and how it works is to think of it as a simplifier and compression algorithm applied to a 3D object mesh, it's a down-detailed zip file of the 3D object. Once the Nanite algorithm is applied the 3D mesh is discarded from the point of view of the game build, you're only keeping the compressed simplified version of that object, only it's skin information. How each triangle on the skin is attached to the next triangle.

Nanite strips out a lot of the 3D mesh information, like bone attachment points, and only considers the positional relationship between triangles that make up the faces of that 3D mesh, it then applies a compression algorithm to that triangle relationship information to compress the information down to a smaller size for download and storage on a hard drive, and for loading into RAM.

This compressed file is searchable by the Nanite algorithm, the compressed file has a rigid structure to make it searchable. The Nanite renderer says to the file loaded on the hard drive, which triangles (parts of the skin) are in direct line of sight to the camera? Show me only those triangles by loading them into RAM / VRAM... ignore any triangles not in direct line of sight of the fixed camera position right now for this frame view... that's why they can't be deformed or be 'see through' because the algorithm has fixed relational data for each triangle and it doesn't account for any triangle not in view, they can only be scaled because the relationship information between each triangle can't change, it can only be calculated from the camera position data. This algorithm that uses the camera position data to plug into is the big selling point, the algorithm says if the camera is far away from the object then reduce the number of triangles and average them out, that's why any game that uses Nanite doesn't need multiple 3D meshes of the same object at different LOD's. It's also why you can't have two different views of the same triangles.

Nanite doesn't support any 3D object mesh that changes shape in engine, nothing with 3D mesh deformation - so no game characters / fauna or wavy flags, no deformable faces, complex hair stranding, clothes or bedsheets, no bendy bushes or trees, no glass objects - it only works for static non-animated solid objects. Nanite rendering is also restricted to 16 Million triangles on screen at any one time. Since a face, the thing texture is applied to is always 2 triangles at least that means 8 Million faces, it's great for close up narrow view of terrain and architecture, not so much for wide angle view open areas populated with 'life', you certainly can't use Nanite for things like waves on water. You might see those things in games made with UE5 but they won't have Nanite applied to them, those objects will use the standard rendering just like all modern game engines, including StarEngine, for threading and rendering.

TL:DR
Any game made with UE5 / Nanite will have to be made with standard 3D geometry for anything you want to see through or see light pass through, anything that moves and deforms via a character rig / bones or material preset and anything you want to see in stereoscopic VR. If someone does MOD Starfield they will have a big job making things persist for more than one player and they will need to have a heck-a-lot of RAM with a very fast access Hard Drive to load top level game objects into more than one cell both for multiplayer and single-player fast traversal over ground, if they can pull it off. How hard is all of that? Bethesda won't even try, they never have. Bethesda makes very good and engaging walking/running single player games with Creation Engine and Starfield is no different.

To say 'non-existent' suggests that it/they doesn't exist anywhere, but it does, we just can't see it.

The character rigs are extremely detailed, we've seen later work. I also got to see them during an office visit in 2016 and they were striking even then you could see each individual stitch, I'm sure they improved muchly since then.

I don't think the post(s) are meandering. Seems coherent to me, though I do recognise some of the talking points from certain echo-chambers that are predominantly negative historically.

Regarding:

Marketing Division - I agree they are out of touch with the community. They have been for many years in my opinion and I've been saying so for at least 7 years. Customer Service lacks direction, they are reactive, not pro-active in my view. It's also my view CIG don't seem to demonstrate the ability to extrapolate the ramifications of their player facing choices into the future, or 'read the crowd'.

Community Engagement - They have made mistakes... I doubt there is anyone, including them, who wouldn't say so. Having talked to Jared in person a little about this I can say that some have the wrong impression. They think that CIG staff aren't highly compartmentalised in the way they work, Jared assures me they are (he stated he has no idea above what the community knows about what is in Squadron 42 for example) and developers when they come on screen say they are not involved in, or aware of, other teams work where there is no cross-over.

Those who have the overall view (senior managers) have been speaking to us about that overall view less and less in the last 3 or 4 years, we have been locked into a 'patch watch' and 'tools watch' cycle and it has not allowed many newcomers to understand the whole aim of the project, it has shut down the dreamers in my opinion, those of us who started with nought but the dream speak a different language to those who haven't experienced it - most of whom wanted to be explorers, even if that meant exploring our imaginations.

When the director of Community Content wants to make a series of videos on a subject he isn't fully aware of the whole picture of current development, and plans change. I agree it doesn't look good when a part 2 is expected and a series they say we should expect gets only one episode - and even though I will be accused of white knighting here - when a group attempt something that has never been done before we might expect it not to wok out as we, or they, expected at the time they say it. Is it any wonder other game development studios don't do it this way?

Squadron 42 - I agree that Chris' decision to blanket 'spoiler' all Squadron 42 progress beyond barely decipherable progress reports to the average and the odd in game feature is not one I would agree with given the nature of this project and it's community, and I have made posts about this. However:

The OP makes assumptions and proceeds as though those assumptions are fact.

Some things in Squadron 42 may take time to adapt to multiplayer, how much time who knows, but many other things will not need to be adapted for multiplayer at all because they are made using the same tools and pipelines as the ones used for Star Citizen, it's the same game engine for both. You can't look at Squadron 42 as one big gooey mass, it is made of component parts and each should be assessed individually to make a determination as to whether they would need any adaptation, and how much. It renders an argument weak to generalise.

Another tacit assumption made by many is that Squadron 42 is like all other single-player FPS games, perhaps 6 - 10 hours gameplay in an 'on rails' environment you can't stray beyond - this is not so. You aren't going from mission to mission with maybe 20 or 30 lines of character dialogue between each mission where you are locked into a small space which is really a loading screen to do not much more than walk around and look at things until you are ready to click on the next mission task. It is not that type of game, time runs 'in real time' while you are playing the story parts, you'll do what you're supposed to do when you're supposed to do it... or else.

When you talk to the development team members in person the one aspect they keep emphasising is how huge / massive the game is, they aren't talking about game-space scale, they are talking about the sheer volume of gameplay content the player will engage in. The things you can and will be doing, the amount of choices you will be making. There is a whole backstory to your character you will play out which gives meaning to what you are doing for the rest of the games.

Even if you attempt a minimalist speed run it will take around 10 times longer to finish the game than the average AAA title... it is massive. The vertical slice shown took 1 hour and it is only a small section of that chapter and it was a minimal spoilers quick demo run-through, I know this for a fact, there were many other characters the player could have talked to and activities the player could (should) engage in. With one of the characters they show you meeting in the vertical slice it isn't the first time you meet them in that chapter, even though it looks like it is. That vertical slice speed-run was carefully set up because they would have revealed some key points of the plot of the first few chapters if they had shown the player doing all the things you could do. That chapter alone has more things for you to do than the average AAA FPS game.

When listening to those questioning how long it should take and how much it costs just ask yourself, compared to what? Which other game are they comparing this behemoth to and why do they think it is anywhere near comparable? If you just take the amount of game feature testing for ten average AAA games, you'll wonder how they did it all this fast and for so little. The word you will see being used to describe Squadron 42 Episode One most often will be 'Epic'.

Another assumption about Squadron 42 Episode 2 and 3 is that they would start from scratch again, common sense tells you this isn't so since the following episodes are a continuation of the player characters' story in the same game universe. They don't have to re-make ships, the flight model, uniforms, animations, the character creation pipeline, weapons, Render To Texture, DNA, in-game feature elements etc - indeed the only parts they have to make new for episodes 2 and 3 are character heads (using the existing pipelines), new locations and Mocap dialogue most of which wouldn't impact the PU hardly at all in terms of the manpower and resources needed.

Server Meshing - as others have pointed out before, the idea isn't new but it has not existed at this scale before. Coming up with an idea is the relatively easy part, making it fit into a live game of this scope is where the hard work is and since there is no precedent for it they have to fit these WIP pieces together as they go... and there is certainly no precedent for that. Server Meshing is not some standalone piece of work, it has to fit within a complex system of interacting parts like PES, the Replication Layer, the whole universe backend simulation that runs in parallel with the live game service alpha.

Since we have agreed that expressing an opinion is valid, it is my opinion that the OP doesn't seem to have a full picture of what Squadron 42 is or a complete overall view of what Star Citizen is planned to be. His conclusions about Episode Two and Three are erroneous and don't take account of work already done. You don't stop to 'pretty up' something while you are still deep in the bowels building it, which is why having a live alpha game release for a WIP game is so exceedingly rare.

The usual response to reminding those with a generally negative attitude that they keep discounting salient differences between this project and other game projects is to insist it's all fantasy, that it will never be finished because look at how long it is taking, that we have all been duped and anyone gainsaying their opinion is deluded and or acting out some version of Stockholm Syndrome. There is no discussion with that type of rationale, they keep insisting others look at the evidence but they won't reasonably consider the evidence presented to them. They don't seem to be aware of the limitations (and the ramifications of them) of other games and how CIG are blowing past those limitations. It is not unreasonable to point to feature development and say, this is new and never tried before certainly not on this scale. It is not unreasonable to ask someone to consider, perhaps this thing is way bigger than your imagination can comprehend, that problems are far harder to solve than you realise and that is it is more reasonable to assume because of this why it should take longer than you imagine it should take.

When CIG casually say they are going to do something, like building interiors in a massive open world MMO, those who have no idea how 'out there' such a thing is accept it just as casually as CIG present it, while those who might have some idea of how radical it is dismiss it as 'crazy', 'insane' and accuse CIG of wild scope creep... who cares, all that matters is... someone is going to try where others have historically insisted it is impossible!

if you don't know what the 'attachment problem' even is, how can you have a reasonably informed opinion on how and why CIG have chosen to solve it instead of the usual 'fake it to make it' approach found in all other games? If you don't care about those novel solutions and features, fine, there are many other games that leave those limitations in, there are plenty out there. If you don't care about pushing those bounds, if you're happy with those historic limitations then frankly this isn't the project for you and that is not a bad thing, enjoy what you enjoy, support what you want to support - just try to understand the aim of this project was to be different, and THIS IS the difference, time and the willingness to go back and rework until they/we get what we wanted is a part of the equation that makes it so different. If you need a publisher, if you need corporate imposed deadlines then go play those games that have them, have fun... come back later if you wish.

Consider:

There are posts telling CIG not to feature things too far out from inclusion in the game at CitizenCon. No long term goals featured that people have to wait long periods to see in the game.

There are posts complaining about the lack of current progress on certain features on ISC's.

These apparently conflicting requests sometimes come from the same people. Unless of course they just repeat information on ISC's, SCL's etc that they cover at CitizenCons.

They have to find content for both.. how do you square this circle?

People are interested in different aspects of game development, some like to see the process of asset creation, some like to see big enabling tech planning and execution, some like to see granular detail on feature development, some like to see deep dives on lore and world building... how to please everyone? The easiest way is to use the correct media for the type of information, some things fit better in monthly reports or Jump Points, web based Q&A's, some fit better on live streams, some are more suited to pre-recorded video shows... and some for live in-person presentations.

If a certain subject is your fascination then perhaps consider looking in the right place for it.

...and what position do you hold at CIG?

Perhaps a senior position at another game development company that does spaceflight combat even?

You see, there are a lot of posts about time estimates for required work from some sections of the community which when examined turn out to be using the POOMA method to calculate.

POOMA = Pulled out of my ass

This is the reason no one takes this kind of guff seriously.

You have no idea what is in the game apart from the revealed A list actors. What have you seen? A short vertical slice that took 1 hour to play through and didn't even take up all the possible options in that section of the game, it didn't even start at the very beginning of that chapter, and it ended long before the end of that chapter - that chapter alone has more events in it, and more things for the player to do, than some AAA games (Like COD Infinite Warfare for example)... and a trailer that tells you, you don't even start the game as a navy pilot.

Where are you in the trailer? Aboard a Javelin - why?. Does Captain McLaren sound like she's talking to a tourist? "I see you've applied to join the flight academy again". She knows you, knows your history. Of all the video we've been shown she and Old Man Colton are the only ones who don't refer to you by your rank. You're not there as a navy pilot, how are you going to become a navy pilot in time for your first posting aboard the Stanton? Why are you present to witness Admiral Bishop say "We will not lose this system" in a fight with the Vanduul, and then later in a different star system fighting mercenaries as a rookie pilot?

You have no idea how long it will take to complete the game. Do you even know that there is a game within the game that will take hours, it's where you do all your training? The average first person story driven triple A takes around 7 - 10 hours. Judging by what I've seen, an average player playing for 3 - 4 hours a day 4 - 5 days a week is going to take a couple of months to finish the game. If anyone is thinking to take the day off work to do a caffeine fueled red-eye playthrough, you won't even get through the first 2 chapters.

You have not much clue about the technical advancement that has gone into the game, even though we have a Roadmap and anyone could go out and find what the limitations of other games are compared to what CIG are doing... but why bother? You can just assume what you like and bang on about it. But then complain if people don't take the argument seriously.

I've been to 2 CitizenCons, BritizenCon 2016 and several BarCitizens, as well as one UK office visit - it is a place where you get to speak to the developers directly, how often does that happen with other games you play? Mostly about the information they have just given but also more detailed stuff, they can put it all into context. It's nice to be able to go into the game and be able to say, I met the guy who made that, he explained why they made it that way.

It's also a place where the team can speak to the players directly and that has an impact on their feeling about the project and it gives them ideas. It is as much of a motivational event for the team as it is for the community. Game developers don't very often get to meet those who play their games, almost certainly not while the game is being made, it changes their attitude to what they are doing now that they don't have to work in absolute secrecy all the time.

You find out things you don't find on video presentations, like how do they feel about working for CIG. They become real people, not just talking images on a screen.

Like trying to explain colour to someone blind from birth, you don't know what you don't know, when you attend these events, you see a little more, a little deeper. Asking questions online most feel ghosted, we're just a part of a crowd, when you ask in person you might not get the answer you want but at least you know they heard you. You can look them in the face, some of the attitudes and language we see directed at team members wouldn't happen if it was all face to face.

You listen to some who try to present an image of Chris and realise, he's just as much of a gamer big kid as the rest of us, he likes to see the costumes people make, the art they are inspired to make, and he talks about other games. He engages with people. When he says he's making the game he always dreamed about playing, that becomes clear when you meet him but each member of the team has their own personality and approach, some are outgoing and lively, some not as much. I've only ever met one team member I didn't like much, he left the company years ago. Generally people who meet Brian Chambers come away with a positive view of him and a respect for his years of experience, he talks to you as though you matter he takes the time to listen and explain things, you can see how he interacts with other members of the team, the same with Tony Zurovec, he is one smart cookie. Todd Papy has a sense of humour and is easy to talk to, just about anyone would be happy to have him as their boss. I've been to other conventions and such, at CIG events you don't get the impression they are there 'just to do a job'.

Producing games is an art form, which artist doesn't like to see others enjoying, engaging with and noticing the details of their labour?

The ship hype stuff doesn't get that much attention when you're actually there, and of course we get the collectibles and see the artistry and ingenuity of other members of the community. The events are full of 'personality's' both known and unknown, you get a bit of epeeing about ships they own and the size of their fleet. The talk isn't all about patch watching it's more about dreams for the future of the game, so that makes a nice change. You find our community (including CIG team members) is generally a tolerant, courteous, well informed, friendly (even generous) bunch nothing like what you see online. First and foremost, for most people who go it's a social thing they are just as keen to go to the after-party meet ups, CIG staff always attend them, you get to hear some gossip about personality's in the community, that sort of thing.

I you like formulaic repetitive teenage angst music, using whole verses of bordering irritatingly elongated vowels to fill time or express false sentiment, go right ahead. 3 words would have sufficed. He got NODs. He's seems to be pleased about it.

Who do I speak to about getting my time back and when does the urge to stop throwing something at the screen go away?

Todd Howard stood on a stage and announced Starfield in 2018 - 5 years ago. Did anyone think it would take another 5 years to arrive? No. The hype train doesn't usually start up it's engines until 18 - 12 months out.

CitizenCon is a mixture of both the informational presentations and the aspirational presentations. This community likes to know what is coming, what the longer term plans are and the majority accept the 'what' is more important than the 'when'. The average time from announcing a new feature or game location at CitizenCon to actually seeing it in game is about 2 years (I'm not talking about back end engineering here, we generally know that takes longer). Again, most know that.

The difference between Bethesda and CIG is that we get constant progress reports keeping those features at the forefront of peoples attention, so of course it seems longer. A watched pot and all that.

Whatever is presented at CitizenCon we know it won't change the overall development, those things would have happened, when they are going to happen, with or without a presentation at CitizenCon.

Those who just want to play a game might prefer the Bethesda approach to communication, those who are as much interested in the process of development as the final product prefer CIG's approach to communication - you pay your money you take your choice. If someone didn't know the nature of the project before they joined they weren't paying attention.

The whole point of this project was to aim for the best possible, not simply the best that can be done within a given timeframe and budget.

I don't see this as any type of argument, I don't follow the logic. Invent a different scenario based upon nothing, presume that scenario must be the case because we haven't heard anything recently to argue against the premise. Why would they even try to refute such a premise if they know they covered the subject, and they have no idea that someone might think up such a thing?

Why would they make such a huge change to their plans, the interview where Chris talked about it happened after all the main story elements were set in stone, ie after the 2015 mocap shoot. We all know they don't endlessly repeat information they've already given us, unless there is a change.

We know they expanded the original story of Squadron 42 both because Chris told us, and because the vertical slice mission is set in a star system that was a $4 million stretch goal - after the original Squadron 42 pitch on Kickstarter. Why would I assume they've taken stuff out while they've been busy adding more stuff?

How far do we go back? 1 year, 2 years? Should we doubt everything more than 2 years old if it's not in the game today, just to suit those who may have a generally negative view? Why not go the whole hog and just presume they've dropped Squadron 42 altogether, they haven't mentioned it in person for about 9 months. Plenty of time to change their minds.

How do we square such scepticism with the fact that Chris has told everyone that if they reach a certain part of Squadron 42 you get 'the badge' to own an F8C Lightning in the PU? Don't we assume that if that changed CIG might expect people to be disgruntled about it?

Struggling to see where such a notion might spring from: Those advertising posters in UEE Naval uniform in the alpha release of the game that say 'Service Guarantees Citizenship' might they not have been quietly taken out?

Absence of [recent] evidence is not evidence of absence. Conspiracy theories are just that, theories.

I recently learned that those who were noisily insisting for years that <a certain anticipated feature> had been dropped completely from the game were just plain wrong, and some of them saying it knew it was wrong even while they were insisting on it. Why do I know? Because it was them I got the evidence of it's continued development from. But hey, they could still have dropped it (again?) in the meantime, who knows? It's not a slam dunk.

Who should I trust? Some guy on the interwebz with a theory or Chris, and Erin who I also spoke to in person about what I mentioned above? I'll leave it to each to make up their own mind... only time will tell.

If the subject comes up I'll put my case to the best of my knowledge, let others make their case and the reader can decide.

This is my advice to anyone: If you get the opportunity go and ask them yourself if it matters to you more than the next ship you want to know about. They get pretty chatty in person and they seem to like it when someone doesn't ask the same questions for the 50th time that day. Pay attention to who you are talking to, the director of community content won't be able to tell whether or when the mech suit will make it into the game. You can find out a few things you thought must be a deep dark secret, turns out, they aren't they just never bothered to mention them publicly or they thought we already knew. Like, the Terra Nova system was going to be the first system in PU, and Terra Prime the first landing zone not Stanton, but they changed their minds when procedural planet tech became a reality, Stanton had more diversity to incrementally test the new tech - apparently. Courtesy of Jared... because I asked, what happened to all the work on Terra Prime?

It's been only 2 years since Tony Zurovec told everyone that virtual AI NPC's have a continuing history log attached to them, and that was the reason for having a running backend simulation of the game universe as well as the live game so that AI NPC's didn't just go into stasis when not spawned in on a DGS around players, why should players have any less in a game planned to have full persistence and character progression? What Chris, Erin and Tony have said consistently makes sense to me taking the aims of the project as a whole, what others might think makes less so.
