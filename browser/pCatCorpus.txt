Breadcrumbs. Some just like the idea of a new trail, nothing wrong with that, any excuse to walk the dog is a good excuse.

There be Mockinjays in those woods.

I like magpies, they collect shiny things and take them to their friends. People have even trained them to steal.

1 for sorrow, 2 for joy, 3 for a girl and 4 for a boy, 5 for silver, 6 for gold, 7 for a secret never to be told.

It's not a leak. It's an official announcement.
https://robertsspaceindustries.com/spectrum/community/SC/forum/1/thread/star-citizen-alpha-3-21-update-1

Patch 3.21 has been released to a PTU. It's a patch that will connect to the game in a different way to what we've had before.

Yes, it may take a lot of cooking. But at least that technology they have been talking about is in a state to let players test it.. so that's new.

They talk about a plan - Don't believe them!
They show progress on the plan - Don't believe them!
They put it in the game build and internally test it - Don't believe them!
They let players test it - Don't believe them!

OK fine... you do you. Bah humbug.

I think they wanted to get into players hands to test it because they know it's the base for the next major content drop yet it's brand new and may take a while to stabilise. Seen it before.

We are allowed to ask why. It's kinda an individual rights thing.

I think the why is because they have a lot of stages to test and they want to get started in the hope it's all done and stable, ready for a content drop for the holidays. But that's just my 2 cents. Someone might mock me and think I'm naive. I might shake my head and think some are just too negative and jaded. We could say it about any game, any politicians promise. If that approach to life gets you through. OK.

Some of us can manage a little disappointment if we had held out a little hope and it didn't happen. Even immersing yourself in the technicality of it has some extrinsic value. Maybe the tide is turning, maybe it's not. A little paddle never hurt anyone, not really. I like surprises but I don't cry myself to sleep if they don't come.

But it is new, it will get the Youtubers fired up. No denying that. Already seen it. The salty became sweet for a while. I always like to see Montoya. He'll be a definite show. They make greetings cards out of a picture of tiny faces pressed against a Victorian shoppe in the snow, no-one hangs a picture of the grumpy old kicked dog hiding in his hole. There'll be some faces at the window, despite the growling.

Why do they put pictures of scruffy half starved little mites against a frozen window of a pie shoppe on holiday cards? I think it's because for a moment we can feel warm thinking that if we were there, we'd give them a hot pie to warm their little bellies. We're inside, we only have to open the door. I hope I would, and that's the thing about hope it's better than free. you can give as much to as many as you like, whenever you like, yet you always have more than enough left over for yourself if you don't let someone take it away from you.

It can and it can't. The Replication Layer can't stop the client disconnect happening if it's between the client and the RL, but it can help stop you losing progress because when you log back in or reconnect everything persisted just where you left it, including you (the player avatar)... depending on how long it takes you to log back in. Someone might come along and pinch your stuff. Your ship might have been stored.. as far as the RL is concerned you alt-F4'd. If you're not connected to the RL, it doesn't know you got a client side 30K notification.

Don't flatter yourself, but thanks for the admission that you find it hard to follow a reasoned argument. However you still miss those nuances. I'm sorry but the word count limit doesn't allow me to keep spelling it out letter by letter.

You're doing it again - you're equating 'late because it's not out and final by their hoped or planned estimate' - with failed. It's not failed, it's late. Failed is missing from a final game release. There has not been a final game release Comprende? Wait - I'll help since you brought up 'defintions'

Failed
1.(of an undertaking or a relationship) not achieving its end or not lasting; unsuccessful. "a failed coup attempt"
2.(of a mechanism) not functioning properly. "an aircraft with a failed engine"

Late
/leÉªt/
adjective
1. doing something or taking place after the expected, proper, or usual time. "his late arrival"
Similar: behind time, behind schedule, not on time, unpunctual, tardy, running late, overdue, delayed.

adverb
1. after the expected, proper, or usual time. "she arrived late"
Similar: behind schedule, behind time

No-one, not even Chris will argue that the game isn't taking longer than expected and by definition (as you say) that means it is late by their previous estimates - I'll give you that. Failed, is completely different. We can discuss the reasons why it is late, but we can't discuss why it failed because it hasn't, they are still working on all of it. It's not a strawman, it's a plain fact.
"My argument is "why have they been so wrong, so consistently, about their ability to get it done in the timelines they themselves put forward" - and it's one you still haven't engaged with, because you keep attempting to change the subject. Why is that?"

There you go, we can discuss that. Thing is, I have engaged with it.
"It's a simplistic notion that just because they talk about something it will arrive tomorrow. There are such things as technical dependencies, unforeseen events and budgetary restrictions."

Too many wordy made all a bit confusing? Eyes go googly? OK I'll break it down:

Technical Dependencies - these are things you need to make things go. If you've never made those things that make things go before, you can only give an estimate about how long it will take to make them. Hence my talking about the difference between Game Design and Game Building. Sorry, promised to keep it simple. My bad.

Some games are built with the same things you built a game with before, so you if you know how long it took before and you make a game with the same tools, very same - you can make a good guess about how long the next game will take to make. Skyrim V and Starfield are very samey gamey, because they made them with same tools! Yay! Getting it now?

Game Design. This is a brand new game! Never made one like it before! It's made with shiny new tools you had to make yourself! First you had to find some clever boys and girls, tell them what you want to make, then they make the tools, they might not get it exactly right the first try but that's OK, and once they've made the tools you can use those to make YOUR GAME! Guessing how long it takes to make tools is hard, really really hard, because even clever girls and boys have to do a real lot of head-scratchy thinking about it. Especially when you need a lot of tools! Knowing which tools you need to make something you've never made before is really really hard. Boo hoo. Sad face.

You know what's even harder? Starting to make your game even while your friends are still making the tools! You don't know how long they will take to make the tools, you have to think about - what can I do while I'm waiting for Craigs tool! and Jonathans tool! and.. and.. Sarah's tool! Oh no!

Here's another of those confusing words. Unforeseen.
It means you didn't know it was gonna happen! Like when some of your friends who've been helping you are sick and away from the playhouse, or or.. they go on holidays! Have ickle babies! Aww!

Or they go away to go play with other friends. Sad face.

Oh No! Now how long will it take to make my game? It'll never be finished on time for my friends party! He'll be very upset!

Sometimes everybody gets sick and we ALL have to move out of the playhouse! Yikes!

We need more friends to help us make our game! but we can't find anymore friends right now, we've got lots of sweets and candies, but no-one wants to play!

Oh wait, we got some new friends but we haven't got enough space, we'll all have to move to a new playhouse, a bigger one! That'll be fun!
Except when he specifically told everyone that even if funding dried up tomorrow, they'd still be able to deliver the game they had sold. Or did you conveniently forget that fact? Here's the quote, in case you did:

"We keep a healthy cash reserve so that if funding stopped tomorrow we would still be able to deliver Star Citizen (not quite to the current level of ambition, but well above what was planned in Oct 2012)."

This just goes to show your lack of critical thinking. That post was from 2014! How many offices did they have? How many staff did they have? How many do they have now?

50 jellybeans divided by 10 playmates, we each get 5 jellybeans! Yay!

Oh no we got more friends, a lot more! Now we have 100 friends!

Only 50 jellybeans! We only get half a jellybean each! Very very sad face!

Oh wait.. that's nice Mummy and Daddy have been giving us more jellybeans all along.. Yay! Everybody still gets 5 jellybeans!

Don't you think they have to keep adding to that reserve, as well as increasing expenses? Where does that come from? Have you actually read their yearly financial statements?

When you grab a quote do you actually read it? The bit in the brackets - (not quite to the current level of ambition, but well above what was planned in Oct 2012). Hmm I wonder what 'not quite the current level of mambition means'? Does it mean 'dumbed down', maybe? Or maybe 'Some things missing?'

It wouldn't take much to go above what was planned in 2012 from the perspective of technical game design, THEY'VE ALREADY SURPASSED IT - as I said. It's not me assuming they haven't done any work on things they haven't shown, I know they have. But some won't be convinced because - "Unless I see it in the game neeeooowww it doesn't exist!" Huh!, I think maybe you're one of them. Fairly sure about it.
"What an inherently stupid idea, stop funding the project and it will get us the whole 100 star systems promised game sooner... and Squadron 42!"

"Well, considering that idea comes directly from Chris Roberts himself, you tell me!"

Are you suggesting Chris is telling everyone to stop contributing to the game? He's gone on social media and said - Don't give any more money! Anybody! No, you don't mean that, you probably had a memory tucked away about him saying - If someone thinks they contributed enough then don't contribute anymore, we're good. But there we go again, it's the same old talky-points arguments. It's only the deluded whales keeping the project afloat! It's not all those newcomers, can't be! Just can't be.

We're done. I can't take you seriously. You seem to have even less grasp of what this project is about, what it's purpose and history is than some who arrived last month.

Sorry, teacher says - you failed!

If there is no break between you and the RL, sure you can reconnect as a replacement DGS is spun up, but if there is a break you'll still see the 30K notification because it's a client side error. We'll see them a LOT less often, but they will still happen. Bad WiFi, bad internet - you know.

If a DGS goes down your game client will keep running as it's connected to the Replication Layer but nothing in the game will respond until you're reconnected to a DGS. The RL doesn't simulate the game world, it just keeps hold of the authority over your game client to keep it running.

Not exactly. Sorry to say.

30K's are a game client notification of game service authority disconnect. Yes, a DGS crash can cause a 30K, but there are other causes.

If there is a network disconnect anywhere between the Replication Layer and your game client for more than a specified period you'll still see a 30K notification.

But yeah, no more 'crash incoming!'

Struggling to understand what you mean here, are you using 'instance' in place of 'Shard'?

Speaking more broadly:

There will be multiple instances of the whole game universe called Shards. There will only be one version of a game location per shard, but each game location will exist on all shards. There won't be copies of game locations per Dedicated Game Server in a shard. Shard 1 will only have one Stanton system and one Pyro system. Shard 2 will have it's own Stanton and Pyro... and so on.

Each shard will have as many meshed servers as it requires per the player population in that shard. Dedicated Game Servers are only spun up for locations where the players are, there won't be empty DGS's spun up, many thousands of players per shard who can all interact via meshed DGS's on that shard. Obviously those parts of the game universe won't have anything happening in them if they aren't spun up on a DGS and that's why the backend simulation is running to make the whole game universe dynamically change over time even in places where there are no players.

As they progress toward Dynamic Server Meshing the number of shards can be reduced but real world signal travel time has some bearing on that. Dynamic Server Meshing is about a more cost efficient use of player servers which will become more population driven rather than game location driven, DSM reduces the need to spin up a game location on a Dedicated Game Server just because one player is present, rather than a location having a fixed game world boundary that boundary can expand or contract according to where the players are.

Taking the extreme example of 1 player in a shard:
If a player is in Stanton then there is a DGS spun up with the Stanton system it has static boundaries, it can only load the Stanton system. That is Static Server Meshing.

If the player wants to go to the Pyro system then another DGS has to be spun up that has Pyro on it so the player can move DGS to DGS to get to Pyro. The Stanton server is then spun down. You need to rent time on two DGS's.

With Dynamic Server Meshing the DGS holding Stanton can have it's boundaries dynamically extended to load Pyro onto the same server, the player goes to Pyro while on the same server. Stanton is then streamed out of that DGS using Server Object Container Streaming. You only need to rent time on one DGS with Dynamic Server Meshing for that player.

Quantum runs a virtual copy for each shard (some things will be copied across shards such as commodity prices etc) it's purpose is to simulate the places where players aren't. Quantum and the vNPC system are to put NPC's and the economy into each shard. Quantum and vNPC's won't be shard hopping at the granular level where players can encounter it directly.

So.. yes there will be thousands of players per shard once Static and Dynamic Server Meshing is in, as to whether there will ever be only one shard for all players that is dependent on solutions to real world signal travel time, so yes it's unlikely in the medium term, even with Dynamic Server Meshing it will remain regional shards for a good while yet. Dynamic Server Meshing is not an answer to signal travel time delay, it is the answer to making server meshing more cost efficient per player. If they can simulate a maximum of 1 million vNPC's on a server running the whole universe and it supplied all shards simultaneously with unique vNPC's then you'd have to divide the number of vNPC's by the number of running shards, it's easier to run 1 million vNPC's per shard since it just requires 1 running simulation server per shard. Players on one shard will not encounter vNPC's on another shard at all just like players on one shard can't encounter players on another shard. If there are 10 shards and 1 million vNPC's shared over all shards then 900,000 vNPC's are being simulated for players that they would never see on their shard.

UE doesn't come with persistence, so far Bethesda's Creation Engine and Starengine are the only major ones that support that feature
Creation Engine 2 doesn't come with any more Persistence than Skyrim V or any other game by Bethesda. Creation Engine, old or new, cannot make un-modded multiplayer games. The persistence comes from the game save stored locally on your hard drive, it is not shared persistence.

Creation Engine 2 uses cell technology just like other Bethesda games to put game content into an area. Imagine a honeycomb grid, the player walks on this grid. The honeycomb cell the player is in is populated by game content via RAM loading, the cells around the cell the player is in are loaded with lower LOD content and that lower LOD content doesn't get thread priority for physics they don't even rig the 3D meshes for characters at the lower LOD's only the top level LOD's are rigged for animation. You can see this in Skyrim V most notably with giants, windmills and waterfalls, they are static and un-animated until you are in the cell they occupy once the LOD's are swapped out. If Todd Howard knew that Creation Engine 2 had changed the way it loaded RAM he would be shouting it from the rooftops because he knows there is an army of modders out there who know the Creation Engine capabilities very well and they would be overjoyed to hear it.

RAM loading takes time so this process is prone to 'popping in' of game assets - this is why they don't have low level high speed over-ground traversal in Starfield, it's why you have an in-engine animated loading screen for flight to ground, once the single POV landing sequence is complete your ship is a static object just like a building or a dungeon. The space flight / space combat will (is seen to be) very basic compared to other games of the type. Starfield has fast travel just like other Bethesda games, it's just hidden behind the non-interactable loading animation.

This cell loading is also why they make single-player games because you can only top LOD load one cell the player is in, any cell another player is in will have less / lower LOD objects in it from the players point of view. The player thinks he is crouching in thick bush and can't be seen, meanwhile the other player sees no bushes around other players, only his own cells bushes. Star Citizen and Squadron 42 use Object Container Streaming for RAM loading, so they don't have this issue or limitations. StarEngine has the limitation that objects are less dense overall, but that is what Server Meshing is planned to fix.

UE5 looks nice but it has limitations, the sort of limitations that make it unusable for a Star Citizen type game. Nanite has a list of things it doesn't support, such as transparency / translucency (there is no light transport through any object rendered via Nanite) and there is no stereoscopic VR capability for Nanite rendered objects. It doesn't support complex UV's or 3D mesh rigging the way StarEngine does and you can only use one type of material preset - solid object.

The easiest way (in my view) to understand what Nanite is and how it works is to think of it as a simplifier and compression algorithm applied to a 3D object mesh, it's a down-detailed zip file of the 3D object. Once the Nanite algorithm is applied the 3D mesh is discarded from the point of view of the game build, you're only keeping the compressed simplified version of that object, only it's skin information. How each triangle on the skin is attached to the next triangle.

Nanite strips out a lot of the 3D mesh information, like bone attachment points, and only considers the positional relationship between triangles that make up the faces of that 3D mesh, it then applies a compression algorithm to that triangle relationship information to compress the information down to a smaller size for download and storage on a hard drive, and for loading into RAM.

This compressed file is searchable by the Nanite algorithm, the compressed file has a rigid structure to make it searchable. The Nanite renderer says to the file loaded on the hard drive, which triangles (parts of the skin) are in direct line of sight to the camera? Show me only those triangles by loading them into RAM / VRAM... ignore any triangles not in direct line of sight of the fixed camera position right now for this frame view... that's why they can't be deformed or be 'see through' because the algorithm has fixed relational data for each triangle and it doesn't account for any triangle not in view, they can only be scaled because the relationship information between each triangle can't change, it can only be calculated from the camera position data. This algorithm that uses the camera position data to plug into is the big selling point, the algorithm says if the camera is far away from the object then reduce the number of triangles and average them out, that's why any game that uses Nanite doesn't need multiple 3D meshes of the same object at different LOD's. It's also why you can't have two different views of the same triangles.

Nanite doesn't support any 3D object mesh that changes shape in engine, nothing with 3D mesh deformation - so no game characters / fauna or wavy flags, no deformable faces, complex hair stranding, clothes or bedsheets, no bendy bushes or trees, no glass objects - it only works for static non-animated solid objects. Nanite rendering is also restricted to 16 Million triangles on screen at any one time. Since a face, the thing texture is applied to is always 2 triangles at least that means 8 Million faces, it's great for close up narrow view of terrain and architecture, not so much for wide angle view open areas populated with 'life', you certainly can't use Nanite for things like waves on water. You might see those things in games made with UE5 but they won't have Nanite applied to them, those objects will use the standard rendering just like all modern game engines, including StarEngine, for threading and rendering.

TL:DR
Any game made with UE5 / Nanite will have to be made with standard 3D geometry for anything you want to see through or see light pass through, anything that moves and deforms via a character rig / bones or material preset and anything you want to see in stereoscopic VR. If someone does MOD Starfield they will have a big job making things persist for more than one player and they will need to have a heck-a-lot of RAM with a very fast access Hard Drive to load top level game objects into more than one cell both for multiplayer and single-player fast traversal over ground, if they can pull it off. How hard is all of that? Bethesda won't even try, they never have. Bethesda makes very good and engaging walking/running single player games with Creation Engine and Starfield is no different.

To say 'non-existent' suggests that it/they doesn't exist anywhere, but it does, we just can't see it.

The character rigs are extremely detailed, we've seen later work. I also got to see them during an office visit in 2016 and they were striking even then you could see each individual stitch, I'm sure they improved muchly since then.

I don't think the post(s) are meandering. Seems coherent to me, though I do recognise some of the talking points from certain echo-chambers that are predominantly negative historically.

Regarding:

Marketing Division - I agree they are out of touch with the community. They have been for many years in my opinion and I've been saying so for at least 7 years. Customer Service lacks direction, they are reactive, not pro-active in my view. It's also my view CIG don't seem to demonstrate the ability to extrapolate the ramifications of their player facing choices into the future, or 'read the crowd'.

Community Engagement - They have made mistakes... I doubt there is anyone, including them, who wouldn't say so. Having talked to Jared in person a little about this I can say that some have the wrong impression. They think that CIG staff aren't highly compartmentalised in the way they work, Jared assures me they are (he stated he has no idea above what the community knows about what is in Squadron 42 for example) and developers when they come on screen say they are not involved in, or aware of, other teams work where there is no cross-over.

Those who have the overall view (senior managers) have been speaking to us about that overall view less and less in the last 3 or 4 years, we have been locked into a 'patch watch' and 'tools watch' cycle and it has not allowed many newcomers to understand the whole aim of the project, it has shut down the dreamers in my opinion, those of us who started with nought but the dream speak a different language to those who haven't experienced it - most of whom wanted to be explorers, even if that meant exploring our imaginations.

When the director of Community Content wants to make a series of videos on a subject he isn't fully aware of the whole picture of current development, and plans change. I agree it doesn't look good when a part 2 is expected and a series they say we should expect gets only one episode - and even though I will be accused of white knighting here - when a group attempt something that has never been done before we might expect it not to wok out as we, or they, expected at the time they say it. Is it any wonder other game development studios don't do it this way?

Squadron 42 - I agree that Chris' decision to blanket 'spoiler' all Squadron 42 progress beyond barely decipherable progress reports to the average and the odd in game feature is not one I would agree with given the nature of this project and it's community, and I have made posts about this. However:

The OP makes assumptions and proceeds as though those assumptions are fact.

Some things in Squadron 42 may take time to adapt to multiplayer, how much time who knows, but many other things will not need to be adapted for multiplayer at all because they are made using the same tools and pipelines as the ones used for Star Citizen, it's the same game engine for both. You can't look at Squadron 42 as one big gooey mass, it is made of component parts and each should be assessed individually to make a determination as to whether they would need any adaptation, and how much. It renders an argument weak to generalise.

Another tacit assumption made by many is that Squadron 42 is like all other single-player FPS games, perhaps 6 - 10 hours gameplay in an 'on rails' environment you can't stray beyond - this is not so. You aren't going from mission to mission with maybe 20 or 30 lines of character dialogue between each mission where you are locked into a small space which is really a loading screen to do not much more than walk around and look at things until you are ready to click on the next mission task. It is not that type of game, time runs 'in real time' while you are playing the story parts, you'll do what you're supposed to do when you're supposed to do it... or else.

When you talk to the development team members in person the one aspect they keep emphasising is how huge / massive the game is, they aren't talking about game-space scale, they are talking about the sheer volume of gameplay content the player will engage in. The things you can and will be doing, the amount of choices you will be making. There is a whole backstory to your character you will play out which gives meaning to what you are doing for the rest of the games.

Even if you attempt a minimalist speed run it will take around 10 times longer to finish the game than the average AAA title... it is massive. The vertical slice shown took 1 hour and it is only a small section of that chapter and it was a minimal spoilers quick demo run-through, I know this for a fact, there were many other characters the player could have talked to and activities the player could (should) engage in. With one of the characters they show you meeting in the vertical slice it isn't the first time you meet them in that chapter, even though it looks like it is. That vertical slice speed-run was carefully set up because they would have revealed some key points of the plot of the first few chapters if they had shown the player doing all the things you could do. That chapter alone has more things for you to do than the average AAA FPS game.

When listening to those questioning how long it should take and how much it costs just ask yourself, compared to what? Which other game are they comparing this behemoth to and why do they think it is anywhere near comparable? If you just take the amount of game feature testing for ten average AAA games, you'll wonder how they did it all this fast and for so little. The word you will see being used to describe Squadron 42 Episode One most often will be 'Epic'.

Another assumption about Squadron 42 Episode 2 and 3 is that they would start from scratch again, common sense tells you this isn't so since the following episodes are a continuation of the player characters' story in the same game universe. They don't have to re-make ships, the flight model, uniforms, animations, the character creation pipeline, weapons, Render To Texture, DNA, in-game feature elements etc - indeed the only parts they have to make new for episodes 2 and 3 are character heads (using the existing pipelines), new locations and Mocap dialogue most of which wouldn't impact the PU hardly at all in terms of the manpower and resources needed.

Server Meshing - as others have pointed out before, the idea isn't new but it has not existed at this scale before. Coming up with an idea is the relatively easy part, making it fit into a live game of this scope is where the hard work is and since there is no precedent for it they have to fit these WIP pieces together as they go... and there is certainly no precedent for that. Server Meshing is not some standalone piece of work, it has to fit within a complex system of interacting parts like PES, the Replication Layer, the whole universe backend simulation that runs in parallel with the live game service alpha.

Since we have agreed that expressing an opinion is valid, it is my opinion that the OP doesn't seem to have a full picture of what Squadron 42 is or a complete overall view of what Star Citizen is planned to be. His conclusions about Episode Two and Three are erroneous and don't take account of work already done. You don't stop to 'pretty up' something while you are still deep in the bowels building it, which is why having a live alpha game release for a WIP game is so exceedingly rare.

The usual response to reminding those with a generally negative attitude that they keep discounting salient differences between this project and other game projects is to insist it's all fantasy, that it will never be finished because look at how long it is taking, that we have all been duped and anyone gainsaying their opinion is deluded and or acting out some version of Stockholm Syndrome. There is no discussion with that type of rationale, they keep insisting others look at the evidence but they won't reasonably consider the evidence presented to them. They don't seem to be aware of the limitations (and the ramifications of them) of other games and how CIG are blowing past those limitations. It is not unreasonable to point to feature development and say, this is new and never tried before certainly not on this scale. It is not unreasonable to ask someone to consider, perhaps this thing is way bigger than your imagination can comprehend, that problems are far harder to solve than you realise and that is it is more reasonable to assume because of this why it should take longer than you imagine it should take.

When CIG casually say they are going to do something, like building interiors in a massive open world MMO, those who have no idea how 'out there' such a thing is accept it just as casually as CIG present it, while those who might have some idea of how radical it is dismiss it as 'crazy', 'insane' and accuse CIG of wild scope creep... who cares, all that matters is... someone is going to try where others have historically insisted it is impossible!

if you don't know what the 'attachment problem' even is, how can you have a reasonably informed opinion on how and why CIG have chosen to solve it instead of the usual 'fake it to make it' approach found in all other games? If you don't care about those novel solutions and features, fine, there are many other games that leave those limitations in, there are plenty out there. If you don't care about pushing those bounds, if you're happy with those historic limitations then frankly this isn't the project for you and that is not a bad thing, enjoy what you enjoy, support what you want to support - just try to understand the aim of this project was to be different, and THIS IS the difference, time and the willingness to go back and rework until they/we get what we wanted is a part of the equation that makes it so different. If you need a publisher, if you need corporate imposed deadlines then go play those games that have them, have fun... come back later if you wish.

Consider:

There are posts telling CIG not to feature things too far out from inclusion in the game at CitizenCon. No long term goals featured that people have to wait long periods to see in the game.

There are posts complaining about the lack of current progress on certain features on ISC's.

These apparently conflicting requests sometimes come from the same people. Unless of course they just repeat information on ISC's, SCL's etc that they cover at CitizenCons.

They have to find content for both.. how do you square this circle?

People are interested in different aspects of game development, some like to see the process of asset creation, some like to see big enabling tech planning and execution, some like to see granular detail on feature development, some like to see deep dives on lore and world building... how to please everyone? The easiest way is to use the correct media for the type of information, some things fit better in monthly reports or Jump Points, web based Q&A's, some fit better on live streams, some are more suited to pre-recorded video shows... and some for live in-person presentations.

If a certain subject is your fascination then perhaps consider looking in the right place for it.

...and what position do you hold at CIG?

Perhaps a senior position at another game development company that does spaceflight combat even?

You see, there are a lot of posts about time estimates for required work from some sections of the community which when examined turn out to be using the POOMA method to calculate.

POOMA = Pulled out of my ass

This is the reason no one takes this kind of guff seriously.

You have no idea what is in the game apart from the revealed A list actors. What have you seen? A short vertical slice that took 1 hour to play through and didn't even take up all the possible options in that section of the game, it didn't even start at the very beginning of that chapter, and it ended long before the end of that chapter - that chapter alone has more events in it, and more things for the player to do, than some AAA games (Like COD Infinite Warfare for example)... and a trailer that tells you, you don't even start the game as a navy pilot.

Where are you in the trailer? Aboard a Javelin - why?. Does Captain McLaren sound like she's talking to a tourist? "I see you've applied to join the flight academy again". She knows you, knows your history. Of all the video we've been shown she and Old Man Colton are the only ones who don't refer to you by your rank. You're not there as a navy pilot, how are you going to become a navy pilot in time for your first posting aboard the Stanton? Why are you present to witness Admiral Bishop say "We will not lose this system" in a fight with the Vanduul, and then later in a different star system fighting mercenaries as a rookie pilot?

You have no idea how long it will take to complete the game. Do you even know that there is a game within the game that will take hours, it's where you do all your training? The average first person story driven triple A takes around 7 - 10 hours. Judging by what I've seen, an average player playing for 3 - 4 hours a day 4 - 5 days a week is going to take a couple of months to finish the game. If anyone is thinking to take the day off work to do a caffeine fueled red-eye playthrough, you won't even get through the first 2 chapters.

You have not much clue about the technical advancement that has gone into the game, even though we have a Roadmap and anyone could go out and find what the limitations of other games are compared to what CIG are doing... but why bother? You can just assume what you like and bang on about it. But then complain if people don't take the argument seriously.

I've been to 2 CitizenCons, BritizenCon 2016 and several BarCitizens, as well as one UK office visit - it is a place where you get to speak to the developers directly, how often does that happen with other games you play? Mostly about the information they have just given but also more detailed stuff, they can put it all into context. It's nice to be able to go into the game and be able to say, I met the guy who made that, he explained why they made it that way.

It's also a place where the team can speak to the players directly and that has an impact on their feeling about the project and it gives them ideas. It is as much of a motivational event for the team as it is for the community. Game developers don't very often get to meet those who play their games, almost certainly not while the game is being made, it changes their attitude to what they are doing now that they don't have to work in absolute secrecy all the time.

You find out things you don't find on video presentations, like how do they feel about working for CIG. They become real people, not just talking images on a screen.

Like trying to explain colour to someone blind from birth, you don't know what you don't know, when you attend these events, you see a little more, a little deeper. Asking questions online most feel ghosted, we're just a part of a crowd, when you ask in person you might not get the answer you want but at least you know they heard you. You can look them in the face, some of the attitudes and language we see directed at team members wouldn't happen if it was all face to face.

You listen to some who try to present an image of Chris and realise, he's just as much of a gamer big kid as the rest of us, he likes to see the costumes people make, the art they are inspired to make, and he talks about other games. He engages with people. When he says he's making the game he always dreamed about playing, that becomes clear when you meet him but each member of the team has their own personality and approach, some are outgoing and lively, some not as much. I've only ever met one team member I didn't like much, he left the company years ago. Generally people who meet Brian Chambers come away with a positive view of him and a respect for his years of experience, he talks to you as though you matter he takes the time to listen and explain things, you can see how he interacts with other members of the team, the same with Tony Zurovec, he is one smart cookie. Todd Papy has a sense of humour and is easy to talk to, just about anyone would be happy to have him as their boss. I've been to other conventions and such, at CIG events you don't get the impression they are there 'just to do a job'.

Producing games is an art form, which artist doesn't like to see others enjoying, engaging with and noticing the details of their labour?

The ship hype stuff doesn't get that much attention when you're actually there, and of course we get the collectibles and see the artistry and ingenuity of other members of the community. The events are full of 'personality's' both known and unknown, you get a bit of epeeing about ships they own and the size of their fleet. The talk isn't all about patch watching it's more about dreams for the future of the game, so that makes a nice change. You find our community (including CIG team members) is generally a tolerant, courteous, well informed, friendly (even generous) bunch nothing like what you see online. First and foremost, for most people who go it's a social thing they are just as keen to go to the after-party meet ups, CIG staff always attend them, you get to hear some gossip about personality's in the community, that sort of thing.

I you like formulaic repetitive teenage angst music, using whole verses of bordering irritatingly elongated vowels to fill time or express false sentiment, go right ahead. 3 words would have sufficed. He got NODs. He's seems to be pleased about it.

Who do I speak to about getting my time back and when does the urge to stop throwing something at the screen go away?

Todd Howard stood on a stage and announced Starfield in 2018 - 5 years ago. Did anyone think it would take another 5 years to arrive? No. The hype train doesn't usually start up it's engines until 18 - 12 months out.

CitizenCon is a mixture of both the informational presentations and the aspirational presentations. This community likes to know what is coming, what the longer term plans are and the majority accept the 'what' is more important than the 'when'. The average time from announcing a new feature or game location at CitizenCon to actually seeing it in game is about 2 years (I'm not talking about back end engineering here, we generally know that takes longer). Again, most know that.

The difference between Bethesda and CIG is that we get constant progress reports keeping those features at the forefront of peoples attention, so of course it seems longer. A watched pot and all that.

Whatever is presented at CitizenCon we know it won't change the overall development, those things would have happened, when they are going to happen, with or without a presentation at CitizenCon.

Those who just want to play a game might prefer the Bethesda approach to communication, those who are as much interested in the process of development as the final product prefer CIG's approach to communication - you pay your money you take your choice. If someone didn't know the nature of the project before they joined they weren't paying attention.

The whole point of this project was to aim for the best possible, not simply the best that can be done within a given timeframe and budget.

I don't see this as any type of argument, I don't follow the logic. Invent a different scenario based upon nothing, presume that scenario must be the case because we haven't heard anything recently to argue against the premise. Why would they even try to refute such a premise if they know they covered the subject, and they have no idea that someone might think up such a thing?

Why would they make such a huge change to their plans, the interview where Chris talked about it happened after all the main story elements were set in stone, ie after the 2015 mocap shoot. We all know they don't endlessly repeat information they've already given us, unless there is a change.

We know they expanded the original story of Squadron 42 both because Chris told us, and because the vertical slice mission is set in a star system that was a $4 million stretch goal - after the original Squadron 42 pitch on Kickstarter. Why would I assume they've taken stuff out while they've been busy adding more stuff?

How far do we go back? 1 year, 2 years? Should we doubt everything more than 2 years old if it's not in the game today, just to suit those who may have a generally negative view? Why not go the whole hog and just presume they've dropped Squadron 42 altogether, they haven't mentioned it in person for about 9 months. Plenty of time to change their minds.

How do we square such scepticism with the fact that Chris has told everyone that if they reach a certain part of Squadron 42 you get 'the badge' to own an F8C Lightning in the PU? Don't we assume that if that changed CIG might expect people to be disgruntled about it?

Struggling to see where such a notion might spring from: Those advertising posters in UEE Naval uniform in the alpha release of the game that say 'Service Guarantees Citizenship' might they not have been quietly taken out?

Absence of [recent] evidence is not evidence of absence. Conspiracy theories are just that, theories.

I recently learned that those who were noisily insisting for years that <a certain anticipated feature> had been dropped completely from the game were just plain wrong, and some of them saying it knew it was wrong even while they were insisting on it. Why do I know? Because it was them I got the evidence of it's continued development from. But hey, they could still have dropped it (again?) in the meantime, who knows? It's not a slam dunk.

Who should I trust? Some guy on the interwebz with a theory or Chris, and Erin who I also spoke to in person about what I mentioned above? I'll leave it to each to make up their own mind... only time will tell.

If the subject comes up I'll put my case to the best of my knowledge, let others make their case and the reader can decide.

This is my advice to anyone: If you get the opportunity go and ask them yourself if it matters to you more than the next ship you want to know about. They get pretty chatty in person and they seem to like it when someone doesn't ask the same questions for the 50th time that day. Pay attention to who you are talking to, the director of community content won't be able to tell whether or when the mech suit will make it into the game. You can find out a few things you thought must be a deep dark secret, turns out, they aren't they just never bothered to mention them publicly or they thought we already knew. Like, the Terra Nova system was going to be the first system in PU, and Terra Prime the first landing zone not Stanton, but they changed their minds when procedural planet tech became a reality, Stanton had more diversity to incrementally test the new tech - apparently. Courtesy of Jared... because I asked, what happened to all the work on Terra Prime?

It's been only 2 years since Tony Zurovec told everyone that virtual AI NPC's have a continuing history log attached to them, and that was the reason for having a running backend simulation of the game universe as well as the live game so that AI NPC's didn't just go into stasis when not spawned in on a DGS around players, why should players have any less in a game planned to have full persistence and character progression? What Chris, Erin and Tony have said consistently makes sense to me taking the aims of the project as a whole, what others might think makes less so.

You may have served your time for a crime, but that crime remains on your history log. Anytime you interact with the system, ATC for example, it is recorded on your history log. If you are scanned by security forces it goes on your history log. NPC's and players can access certain parts of history logs depending on the level of access they have, this isn't just a faction rating. Bounty hunters and the Advocacy can track you via your history log. Anyone in the game can decide if they don't like what they see on your history log they can deny you access to places and services. They just don't want your type around here.

When you play Squadron 42 you have a military history log, parts of that history go to your player log in the PU after you retire your character to the PU. When you undertake Advocacy missions currently in the PU you may notice Dully stipulates those with the requisite experience, of course right now it is assumed everyone has that experience, but once Squadron 42 comes out and the full reputation system goes into the PU, it will be limited to those with the relevant experience.

Things on your history log will determine what missions you can take, places you can go and even what equipment you will be allowed to legally own and use in UEE controlled areas. If you don't at least start Squadron 42 with a character you enter the PU as a civilian not a citizen. That will affect things you can do in the game. There are other ways to get citizenship but they are not easy, if you have a history of criminality on your history log it will be even harder or near impossible to get citizenship. There is no other other way to get ex-military status without starting Squadron 42. There are factions, like the Advocacy, where having a military history will be a benefit, there are factions (even if you've never interacted with them) who will be very suspicious of your military history, they may even attack you on sight because of it.

The UEE can revoke citizenship, for criminal history for example. When you leave the Klescher Rehab facility notice he (the guy on the tannoy system) calls you civilian, not citizen. There will be factions in the game who may not be criminal, but they just don't like the UEE, it is a militaristic empire run by an elite class (only Citizens can vote in UEE elections or stand for office, UEE citizens pay less tax to the UEE), and they see anyone wearing the uniform of the UEE as the jackboot of the UEE, they remember Anthony Tanaka.

It did add new things to do for those with the imagination to figure them out.

It did change the way we play, if you did a bunker mission before PES, if you went away and came back all the loot was gone, now it isn't. If you shot down a ship it de-spawned and you got nothing, now you can go loot it, and salvage it, whenever you're ready.

You don't think salvage was a significant add to game play this year? I think many might disagree with you. "..nobody is allowed to make money in the PU without combat being involved.", that's only for the salvage missions or those who want to engage in PvP, you can salvage ships anytime you find them, no-one needs to know you're there.

It does fit the sandbox genre, however where it goes beyond the sandbox MMO genre is the plan for the living breathing universe populated with active AI. As is usual for CIG they don't want to go with the standard form of AI and a faked background economy and lore they want to create a whole new type of AI and a universe that is self-sustaining and continually changing. Tony Zurovec explained it very well in his presentation, it's too expensive to keep tens of thousands of active goal orientated AI in live server memory and if they aren't in memory then they can't do anything - that is one of those hard facts of life you just can't ignore, data written on a hard drive doesn't change.

You can't manually script tens of thousands of NPC's unless they are all doing easily repeatable predictable behaviours - this would be the standard approach. How many games have free roam NPC's using their own vehicles and using public transport? Working toward their own goals? The current NPC's are running on legacy CryEngine logic via Subsumption, that's why they are static in a location, it's the same type of scripted NPC logic you find in all other games. Ironic isn't it? They want Star Citizen to be made like other games, yet the features of those games technology that remain in Star Citizen are their biggest source of complaint.

Sir Isaac Newton said "If I have seen further it is because I have stood on the shoulders of giants", while he was sarcastically mocking a rival scientist who was short in stature, it's still a truism, very little innovation comes all at once, it is a step by step process and hardly anyone could envision the changes Newton's work would have on the world, until it did. CIG are taking the step by step process.

Innovation takes time, frustrating, annoying and at times even boring though it may be it's the innovation that people will notice and remember. We have been through the content drought doldrums before while they work on underlying tech, we have heard people say they would never achieve what they plan, they still say it about things that are actually in the game - but they did achieve those things.

There's a reason other game studios don't do this type of stuff, venture capitalists, publishers and investors are even more susceptible to frustration, impatience and boredom than players.

We paid for, and signed up for, a different approach to game making, this is it, and there's no one else trying it at this scope and scale.

Those who use words like 'nothing', 'never', impossible' are only telling you the limit of their imagination. They aren't even being accurate about the current state of progress in many cases. They struggle to understand the difference between a locally stored game save on their hard drive giving the impression of persistence for a single player game and a massive cloud based game save of all the events in a whole game universe, and all the players in it.

They say they have the right to criticise and complain, which they do, but if they can't be accurate in their assessment of progress or understand why it has to be this way how much validity should we give their assessment of progress? Read through the comments on this thread, some are clearly not up to speed either with the aims of the project or even the current progress of it. They certainly don't seem to understand the limitations of the games they keep touting as better examples.

None of them have produced anything that benefits a single player, let alone advanced the player experience, and with such a negative attitude it's very unlikely they ever will. It's up to the individual who they choose to give their ear to - the builders building your house, or the guy at the gate telling them how to build a house when he hasn't seen the plans and has never so much as built a garden shed in his life.

If it frustrates some, if they can't wrap their head around why it has to be this way then surely it's best to just go play other games and come back periodically to see progress. Take some time to learn about the limitations of other games so that when they do see that progress they can understand the significance of it. Some just want 'a' game, but some of us wanted more... judging by the success of the project I'd say those who wanted more seem to be in the driving seat, if someone doesn't like where it's going, or it's not going fast enough for them they can get off the bus and walk around for a while, they're more than welcome to come back further down the line because unlike other games your ticket is a lifetime ticket to ride even if they upgrade the service.

Authority over all in game entities comes from the Replication Layer, they are working on that first. The Replication Layer was planned and designed exactly for the purpose of information sharing across DGS's and the Persistence Layer, as well as all other back end services.

The idea that you wouldn't hear any sound in space is erroneous, it's akin to hearing 'There's no gravity in space' of course there is, if there weren't why would moons go around planets and planets go around a star?

Why you would hear sound:

1. There's atmosphere in your ship, unless you remove it. There is atmosphere inside your helmet. Your ears are never directly next to the vacuum of space, unless you're dead in which case you wouldn't hear anything anyway.

2. When an explosion happens in space the explosive material expands as a gas and debris, inside the expanding gas shockwave is an 'atmosphere' which is reducing in density over time, it's the gasified molecules that the explosive was made of. Those expanding gas particles can/will impact the hull of a ship which causes vibration, that vibration is then passed to air in the ship and thus to your ears. In atmosphere the shockwave (sound wave) travels faster than the gas particles because being bigger those particles impact molecules in the air and lose momentum,, that momentum passes to the air molecules but in space the shockwave travels with the leading edge of the particles because those gas molecules aren't impacting anything. The shockwave will still impact any solid object and impart momentum to it, the amount depending on the density of particles inside the gas bubble and the cross-sectional area of the ship which is in a direct line of sight to those high velocity particles.

3. Solid objects, including high velocity engine trail particles, impacting the hull of a ship or helmet of a player will cause soundwaves inside the ship or the helmet because each action has an equal and opposite reaction. The sound you hear is the collision of the electrons of the object and impactor.

That is not to say this is exactly how it works in Star Citizen, because it is a game real world physics is simulated, but the idea that you wouldn't hear sound in space with explosions nearby, in the wash of an engine or with projectiles hitting things is not true while in a ship or in a helmet. You wouldn't hear the sound of objects / particles hitting anything else if separated by a vacuum, but you would hear them hitting anything you're inside of. What is unrealistic is having the sound travel at the same speed as the light, there should be a delay between seeing the explosion and hearing it, depending on how far away it is and the further away the more the sound should be muffled / lowered in frequency and volume.

I guess you missed the CIG communications regarding building interiors and underground infrastructure.

Also, they aren't waiting on Server Meshing to add Pyro.

I think it's referring to the holographic control consoles. We've seen still images of an example of them. iirc more related to engineering and systems management gameplay.

Heh heh.. got some cream? This burn is stinging mightily.

You'll be the guy to ask, Stuart must be asleep. What are we going to talk to our therapists about this coming Monday week? 21st.

I've checked all the national days CIG might be supporting, not much going on. Does anyone feel strongly about: National potato day, national mosquito day - a bit of a prickly subject. National Pecan pie day.. National soft ice cream day?

I'm sure we'll think of something.

Yep, the usual crowd in for their weekly echo-chamber shenannigins..

On a completely unrelated note...

Hey Stuart! How's Elite Dangerous coming along? Excited for the future? Haven't seen you in a long while, over here at least.

Oh...! the drama was just too irresistible and dragged you away from your intense gameplay and all those hot new feature discussions! eh?

Quick question, since you're hanging around with us for a bit - have they managed to get all two and half thousand of you lot onto one server yet? Do you find all those FDev community meet ups a bit samey like we do? Are all the old boys gonna be losing you to Starfield? Just think, an exciting new space game AND the opportunity for y'all to keep popping in and telling us how it should be done! Oh joy! Looking forward to it! Don't be a stranger.

Which magazine are we looking out for? C'mon spill the beanz - Kotaku again? Please... tell me it's not...Forbes!.. I couldn't stand the excitement! You'll get old Montoya really going with that!

Er.. just in case you hadn't noticed since you been away for a while an'all... it's ALL still here, going strong. How do they just keep on surviving all these dramas? You all work so hard!

Darn it!

No seriously.. welcome back to the land of the living, good to see ya old mate. For a while there I thought you might have given it all up!

[edit] In my excitement to see old friends I forgot to post on topic. I'm a Space Marshal, not currently subscribing, couldn't care less about PTU access waves. Having fun stuffing popcorn and watching others wet their knickers about it all, a little lite relief from the more serious stuff never hurt anyone.

They had one private investor in 2018 (a couple of years before they started regularly hitting the $100+ Million per year mark) who bought a minority 10% non-voting rights position for $46 Million, with an option to buy more shares (due to the company increasing in value), which strangely enough they took up... I wonder why if they were so anxious? $46 Million and no due diligence? Just as an aside to keep things in perspective, this same family business donated $107 million to South Africa's 'fight COVID' campaign in 2020, do they sound desperate for a few mil?

Who is this mysterious investor? It's the Calder family, father Clive and son Keith Calder (Snoot Entertainment) net worth $5.5 Billion. Made their fortune with record label companies and media distribution. You might know a few of their artists on the Jive record label: Britney Spears, Backstreet Boys, NSYNC to name a few. They specialise in marketing and distribution, indeed Sandi Gardner said the money was specifically ear-marked for the Squadron 42 marketing campaign to come. (Some of us remember Chris saying that no pre-release backer funds would be spent on marketing.) A quote echoed in the Forbes magazine article about the investment.

'Most' suggests multiple, there's only one and I don't see Forbes writing any articles about how the Calders feel about CIG buying into Turbulent and announcing it this year, do you? Or setting up bigger offices in the UK and Germany last year, and a new expanded office in Montreal before that. You can see how CIG are r.e.a.l.l.y struggling eh? If you actually bothered to look at CIG's financials you'd know they've already been paid a dividend on that investment, a tiny percentage of CIG's 2021 earnings. A sum significantly less than CIG's increased earnings for 2022 over 2021 (Around $26 Million increase). I wonder who's been helping them with all the marketing expertise?

Further to your point about trust.

When you catch someone in a lie, and you know they are pushing that lie frequently to try to make another party look bad, it's not hard to see who to trust.

When they keep saying to their hangers-on... Go ask about <this feature> and why CIG just dropped it after all that work, pushing it on every platform they have and even making it into a running joke at the other party's expense guaranteed to get upvotes every time it's mentioned, and you know for a fact that they know that isn't the case. Every 5 minutes we get someone primed to come and ask about it or hammer with ridicule anyone who says it's going to be in the game, or they want to see it in the game, it's a constant talking point in the circles they run, yet they know exactly what happened to it.

There isn't a better definition of FUD than deliberately misleading people, encouraging them to labour under a mis-apprehension for years when you've been holding onto good evidence to say the contrary. A simple line of text from the right person who frequents those circles would correct that mis-apprehension.

Here's the thing. We are limited in what we can talk about on Spectrum. Those who want to spread FUD use that fact to mislead. Those who are mislead think they are doing 'the good work' they've been charged and 'ginned up' to do.

Those who are responsible for spreading the FUD absolutely KNOW very well that the impression they are trying to give is not true because they have had access to sources of information for years that we can't talk about. I KNOW because I have seen some of those sources, I got them from them.

Did they feature that information on their Youtube channel or Discord dedicated to giving out information to everyone - no they didn't - I wonder why?

When they pass on information to Youtubers willing to spread unauthorised information do they include it all? No they don't. I wonder why?

Do they use the lack of moderation on a weekend or Reddit to give out the information that disproves their FUD the way they use it to spread their FUD? No they don't. I wonder why.

If you don't know what I'm talking about I suggest you go back to those whispering into your ear and ask them, why do you curate what information you know, have known, for years? Why don't you just give it all and let everyone decide?

You've more chance to find out that way than noise posting on Spectrum... but don't bet on it.

This is what I now KNOW - Squadron 42 E1 is going to be much better than I was expecting it to be. So... thanks.

This old chestnut again... sigh.. it is not two games, it is one game universe. Squadron 42 takes place in the same game universe, all the places, factions and assets come to the PU... even some of the characters may come to the PU. They are cross-connected. You play the same character in both if you choose to retire your character to the PU and there will be rewards and missions that go with having played Squadron 42. Things you gain in Squadron 42 transfer with you to the PU. It will be the same with the next episodes of Squadron 42 to follow, indeed any story they decide to tell in that game universe.

Why don't they have multiple strategies? The do, but ultimately they have to decide on one and focus on it, but be agile enough to re-plan - which they are. The Replication Layer is being separated from the DGS functions to facilitate moving forward with the plans for Pyro (and other star systems) while they work on Server Meshing. We have a released playable alpha even without Server Meshing.

These ideas don't come out of the blue, they look at known technology and think about what would be best for the game in the long term, something other game development companies don't have the luxury of. They inherited most of the R&D team from CryTek and a lot of the innovation is due to their continued work. Thy have also recruited very experienced people from Ubisoft, Bethesda and Sony Entertainment Division. The change from iCache came about because they looked at wider uses of customer databases in the computer technology industry. CIG can do this sort of wider-looking innovation because they are not locked into using a particular feature-locked engine which had to be stipulated at the start to be able to raise investor capital.

We will get building interiors and underground areas at a level of realism you don't find in games of this type because CIG don't lay off developers, and because there are no investors to say that we can't have them. Rockstar have taken hundreds of billions of dollars in sales of the GTA franchise and it's taken this long to get vehicle interiors fully modelled.

There are fall-backs if something doesn't work out. Chris could release a better version of a Starfield-type game with just the updated CryEngine they have now. The innovation doesn't slow development as much as people think, it is ongoing while they build the game - which is huge by the way. When you know that a standard game developer lays off teams once their part of a game is done in cost-cutting exercises you realise why Star Citizen is different, they don't do that they allow existing teams to look at innovation while the other teams continue their work, this allows feed-back between teams that otherwise wouldn't happen allowing continual improvement.

Yes, it's a different way of doing it, but we all wanted a different game experience, not just Chris Roberts. That's the whole point of this project and why it was directly funded by the players, not investors waiting for a return of profits that leech away funding for innovation.

You're not buying a game, you're buying the right to create unique characters who live their lives in this whole game universe, the clock starts ticking on this game universe when Squadron 42 Episode One is released and it never stops until the game universe is abandoned, and that won't be for many many years. It will be continually added to and improved, even better you don't have to keep paying for those improvements the way you do with other game releases.

Partially true but what you're alluding to... not necessarily.

Squadron 42 E2 and E3 will re-use a good deal of the assets from E1. The engine and tools won't need to be remade, there won't need to be re-modelling of existing main actors, many ships / vehicles have already been made and work flows have been refined to name but a few. Most of the new teams are allocated work for the PU and it's clear they are continuing to recruit.

I personally don't think that it is coincidence many new hires are coming from companies who have game products nearing completion, Bethesda for example. The advantage that CIG has over some companies is that they don't lay off teams when a game project goes through it's various phases because there is years worth of work still to come. In my estimation this would make CIG more attractive as a proposition to prospective recruits. I've heard this said by team members in person. They see more opportunity for advancement with CIG and that is a direct result of CIG having longer term plans.

This is not at all true. Jared has spoken of this many times and even in the last SCL.

Not only are they hiring teams for PU work, they are refining the tools and specifically designing tools to be easier to use for non-specialist game builders reducing the need for highly trained systems designers. As tools are finalised more and more team members will become proficient at using those tools.

Core tech pillars won't have to be remade and once completed existing assets made after them won't need any form of rework to work with those features, we've seen this with the ship pipeline ships and vehicles are being produced in a more finished state. The time they have taken to make those tools will shorten development time for future assets. They haven't just made tools for current usage those tools are designed for future planned assets as well, they have told us many times that pipelines are more streamlined and assets are being produced at a faster and faster pace. The amount of R&D required will gradually reduce.

Also we should not forget that work done on any version of Squadron 42 feeds into the PU. Those who insist that Squadron 42 assets will need years of work to come to the PU are frankly uninformed and most probably just deliberately spreading FUD. A great many assets that we don't know about and haven't seen are just waiting for core tech to be ready.

It's been a long time since I bothered shooting at anyone in the game, it's not because I'm a pacifist, it's because while they're changing things around I prefer to concentrate on skills for things they don't change like escape and evasion. I realise that won't help them testing but frankly I'd rather leave that to others since I'm 61 and now reflexes and eyesight aren't what they used to be. I also don't particularly like the message that some put out that you're automatically locked into fighting just because someone attacks you, it isn't true and we shouldn't give people the impression that it is. I played Ace Combat for hundreds of hours, but when they brought out Skies Unknown with it's arcadey 'mash buttons to enter dogfight mode' it killed it for me because it forced a particular type of play and tactics.

Having said that thinking about the actual game and it's differences between WWII style dogfighting a couple of things occur to me:

Combat is in space and gravity's / atmospheres that are different to Earth.

We have shields of varying abilities.

We 'should' have computers with advanced capabilities.

We have 6 degrees of freedom flight.

We have in-lore manufacturers of microtechnology.

My instinct is to do what @hcvertigo alludes to and view those making instructional videos and argument videos for changes referring to real world dogfighting, with dumbfire weapons, with scepticism.

One of the reasons for Congressional hearings on UAP's is given as UAP appear to have 6 degrees of freedom in atmosphere flight capabilites at acceleration rates which appear to defy / negate G forces. So frankly taking conventional aerial dogfighting and trying to extrapolate from that doesn't even work in the present day, and their military experts know that well enough to be worried about it.

In the game how would I do it?

I'd try to be realistic and just accept the facts. I'd make weapons and weapon classes that seek to negate some of those capabilities. I'd have area weapons that can both get into the targets probable path (flak) and do area damage to shields / armour. With the ship platforms we have in the game I see no reason why we can't have flak type weapons, targetted area weapons, on medium ships and heavy fighters / bombers with intelligent ammunition. This 'all projectiles are dumbfire' is anachronistic. I should be able to aim in the general direction of a target and let the ammunition guide itself to the target once in range, ballistics with short duration self guiding directional capability, lower fire rate and reduced damage compared to similar sized dumbfire projectiles. No-one needs a lead or lag pip on an anti-tank Javelin, you only need to specify the target selection. I'm fairly sure that microtechnology has improved by the 29th century to be able to allow that.

Directed energy weapons and dumbfire ballistics should be for precision strikes once you have sufficiently reduced your enemy's capability to resist attack and you can get in close enough to smell it's exhaust fumes. The aim is not to destroy but to remove their ability to fight back. In that case each weapon has a use case. If someone can fit all the same weapon on a ship and still come out victorious against a variety of targets the majority of the time, this in my view is neither realistic nor balanced. The weapon designers, defensive capability designers would have to be pretty unimaginative in the future if that were the case.

A good pilot should know when and where to use the capabilities of what they have chosen to load out with. Fighters as first strike works great if your opponents have little to no shields and thin metal coatings over sensitive areas and limited maneuvering capabilities, but if they don't have those limitations then the battle order should be reconsidered even in small scale, small ship encounters. Land forces know, you pound the enemy from range and only once you have reduced their fighting capability do you send in the troops for more precision. This is in my estimation why they have gotten themselves locked into this 'keep them close' even when the combatants have all teeth and claws intact rather unrealistic situation that they don't impose on capital to capital ship and land forces offensive behaviour. It's not 29th century dogfighting in space, it's 2nd century pointy blade fighting.

The play experience shouldn't be about fancy footwork, twitch and yank with all guns blazing it should be about intelligent platform and weapon selection and use of the tools you have at hand. In which case set your visual guides to suggest that. I wouldn't have lead and lag pips at all, I'd have the target reticle on what you choose to aim for and have a lock on indicator for dumbfire projectiles to tell you when the optimal time to fire is, then you use your ships capability and flight skills to get into the best position to give you the optimal position to fire with the weapon you selected to do the job. If you're using gimballed weapons put a converging indicator on helmet screen to show where your shots will go when you pull the trigger based upon what your ship is currently doing rather than trying to predict what the enemy is doing or going to do, leave that to the player. It is then purely skill based.

Defensive or counter-offensive weapons should equally be about selecting the right tool for the job at the right time. I find it very odd that fighting in space with 6DoF flight should entail firing counter-offensive always directly to the rear, even modern aircraft don't do that. I should be able to fire counter-offensives ahead of me, or in any direction, and have to learn to time it so that I don't fly into them. There's no air resistance in space and variable resistance depending on atmospheric density, the ships velocity should add to the velocity of the projectiles. I should be able to do what any octopus and squid has learned to do, put up a temporary screen so that it becomes a game of attrition and cat and mouse.

So you think CIG should survey every game package holder and have everyone fill out a form at point of sale for their health records and factor them into their game design plans? People die every day, sad, but a fact of life. The same could be said of any service offered to a customer. Build you a house you say, OK we'd better just knock a few bits of plywood together, you don't look well.

It's not a cogent argument to base a project on, there's nothing they can reasonably do about it. They're in the same boat, Chris isn't a young buck either.
