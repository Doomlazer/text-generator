Breadcrumbs. Some just like the idea of a new trail, nothing wrong with that, any excuse to walk the dog is a good excuse.

There be Mockinjays in those woods.

I like magpies, they collect shiny things and take them to their friends. People have even trained them to steal.

1 for sorrow, 2 for joy, 3 for a girl and 4 for a boy, 5 for silver, 6 for gold, 7 for a secret never to be told.

It's not a leak. It's an official announcement.
https://robertsspaceindustries.com/spectrum/community/SC/forum/1/thread/star-citizen-alpha-3-21-update-1

Patch 3.21 has been released to a PTU. It's a patch that will connect to the game in a different way to what we've had before.

Yes, it may take a lot of cooking. But at least that technology they have been talking about is in a state to let players test it.. so that's new.

They talk about a plan - Don't believe them!
They show progress on the plan - Don't believe them!
They put it in the game build and internally test it - Don't believe them!
They let players test it - Don't believe them!

OK fine... you do you. Bah humbug.

I think they wanted to get into players hands to test it because they know it's the base for the next major content drop yet it's brand new and may take a while to stabilise. Seen it before.

We are allowed to ask why. It's kinda an individual rights thing.

I think the why is because they have a lot of stages to test and they want to get started in the hope it's all done and stable, ready for a content drop for the holidays. But that's just my 2 cents. Someone might mock me and think I'm naive. I might shake my head and think some are just too negative and jaded. We could say it about any game, any politicians promise. If that approach to life gets you through. OK.

Some of us can manage a little disappointment if we had held out a little hope and it didn't happen. Even immersing yourself in the technicality of it has some extrinsic value. Maybe the tide is turning, maybe it's not. A little paddle never hurt anyone, not really. I like surprises but I don't cry myself to sleep if they don't come.

But it is new, it will get the Youtubers fired up. No denying that. Already seen it. The salty became sweet for a while. I always like to see Montoya. He'll be a definite show. They make greetings cards out of a picture of tiny faces pressed against a Victorian shoppe in the snow, no-one hangs a picture of the grumpy old kicked dog hiding in his hole. There'll be some faces at the window, despite the growling.

Why do they put pictures of scruffy half starved little mites against a frozen window of a pie shoppe on holiday cards? I think it's because for a moment we can feel warm thinking that if we were there, we'd give them a hot pie to warm their little bellies. We're inside, we only have to open the door. I hope I would, and that's the thing about hope it's better than free. you can give as much to as many as you like, whenever you like, yet you always have more than enough left over for yourself if you don't let someone take it away from you.

It can and it can't. The Replication Layer can't stop the client disconnect happening if it's between the client and the RL, but it can help stop you losing progress because when you log back in or reconnect everything persisted just where you left it, including you (the player avatar)... depending on how long it takes you to log back in. Someone might come along and pinch your stuff. Your ship might have been stored.. as far as the RL is concerned you alt-F4'd. If you're not connected to the RL, it doesn't know you got a client side 30K notification.

Don't flatter yourself, but thanks for the admission that you find it hard to follow a reasoned argument. However you still miss those nuances. I'm sorry but the word count limit doesn't allow me to keep spelling it out letter by letter.

You're doing it again - you're equating 'late because it's not out and final by their hoped or planned estimate' - with failed. It's not failed, it's late. Failed is missing from a final game release. There has not been a final game release Comprende? Wait - I'll help since you brought up 'defintions'

Failed
1.(of an undertaking or a relationship) not achieving its end or not lasting; unsuccessful. "a failed coup attempt"
2.(of a mechanism) not functioning properly. "an aircraft with a failed engine"

Late
/leÉªt/
adjective
1. doing something or taking place after the expected, proper, or usual time. "his late arrival"
Similar: behind time, behind schedule, not on time, unpunctual, tardy, running late, overdue, delayed.

adverb
1. after the expected, proper, or usual time. "she arrived late"
Similar: behind schedule, behind time

No-one, not even Chris will argue that the game isn't taking longer than expected and by definition (as you say) that means it is late by their previous estimates - I'll give you that. Failed, is completely different. We can discuss the reasons why it is late, but we can't discuss why it failed because it hasn't, they are still working on all of it. It's not a strawman, it's a plain fact.
"My argument is "why have they been so wrong, so consistently, about their ability to get it done in the timelines they themselves put forward" - and it's one you still haven't engaged with, because you keep attempting to change the subject. Why is that?"

There you go, we can discuss that. Thing is, I have engaged with it.
"It's a simplistic notion that just because they talk about something it will arrive tomorrow. There are such things as technical dependencies, unforeseen events and budgetary restrictions."

Too many wordy made all a bit confusing? Eyes go googly? OK I'll break it down:

Technical Dependencies - these are things you need to make things go. If you've never made those things that make things go before, you can only give an estimate about how long it will take to make them. Hence my talking about the difference between Game Design and Game Building. Sorry, promised to keep it simple. My bad.

Some games are built with the same things you built a game with before, so you if you know how long it took before and you make a game with the same tools, very same - you can make a good guess about how long the next game will take to make. Skyrim V and Starfield are very samey gamey, because they made them with same tools! Yay! Getting it now?

Game Design. This is a brand new game! Never made one like it before! It's made with shiny new tools you had to make yourself! First you had to find some clever boys and girls, tell them what you want to make, then they make the tools, they might not get it exactly right the first try but that's OK, and once they've made the tools you can use those to make YOUR GAME! Guessing how long it takes to make tools is hard, really really hard, because even clever girls and boys have to do a real lot of head-scratchy thinking about it. Especially when you need a lot of tools! Knowing which tools you need to make something you've never made before is really really hard. Boo hoo. Sad face.

You know what's even harder? Starting to make your game even while your friends are still making the tools! You don't know how long they will take to make the tools, you have to think about - what can I do while I'm waiting for Craigs tool! and Jonathans tool! and.. and.. Sarah's tool! Oh no!

Here's another of those confusing words. Unforeseen.
It means you didn't know it was gonna happen! Like when some of your friends who've been helping you are sick and away from the playhouse, or or.. they go on holidays! Have ickle babies! Aww!

Or they go away to go play with other friends. Sad face.

Oh No! Now how long will it take to make my game? It'll never be finished on time for my friends party! He'll be very upset!

Sometimes everybody gets sick and we ALL have to move out of the playhouse! Yikes!

We need more friends to help us make our game! but we can't find anymore friends right now, we've got lots of sweets and candies, but no-one wants to play!

Oh wait, we got some new friends but we haven't got enough space, we'll all have to move to a new playhouse, a bigger one! That'll be fun!
Except when he specifically told everyone that even if funding dried up tomorrow, they'd still be able to deliver the game they had sold. Or did you conveniently forget that fact? Here's the quote, in case you did:

"We keep a healthy cash reserve so that if funding stopped tomorrow we would still be able to deliver Star Citizen (not quite to the current level of ambition, but well above what was planned in Oct 2012)."

This just goes to show your lack of critical thinking. That post was from 2014! How many offices did they have? How many staff did they have? How many do they have now?

50 jellybeans divided by 10 playmates, we each get 5 jellybeans! Yay!

Oh no we got more friends, a lot more! Now we have 100 friends!

Only 50 jellybeans! We only get half a jellybean each! Very very sad face!

Oh wait.. that's nice Mummy and Daddy have been giving us more jellybeans all along.. Yay! Everybody still gets 5 jellybeans!

Don't you think they have to keep adding to that reserve, as well as increasing expenses? Where does that come from? Have you actually read their yearly financial statements?

When you grab a quote do you actually read it? The bit in the brackets - (not quite to the current level of ambition, but well above what was planned in Oct 2012). Hmm I wonder what 'not quite the current level of mambition means'? Does it mean 'dumbed down', maybe? Or maybe 'Some things missing?'

It wouldn't take much to go above what was planned in 2012 from the perspective of technical game design, THEY'VE ALREADY SURPASSED IT - as I said. It's not me assuming they haven't done any work on things they haven't shown, I know they have. But some won't be convinced because - "Unless I see it in the game neeeooowww it doesn't exist!" Huh!, I think maybe you're one of them. Fairly sure about it.
"What an inherently stupid idea, stop funding the project and it will get us the whole 100 star systems promised game sooner... and Squadron 42!"

"Well, considering that idea comes directly from Chris Roberts himself, you tell me!"

Are you suggesting Chris is telling everyone to stop contributing to the game? He's gone on social media and said - Don't give any more money! Anybody! No, you don't mean that, you probably had a memory tucked away about him saying - If someone thinks they contributed enough then don't contribute anymore, we're good. But there we go again, it's the same old talky-points arguments. It's only the deluded whales keeping the project afloat! It's not all those newcomers, can't be! Just can't be.

We're done. I can't take you seriously. You seem to have even less grasp of what this project is about, what it's purpose and history is than some who arrived last month.

Sorry, teacher says - you failed!

If there is no break between you and the RL, sure you can reconnect as a replacement DGS is spun up, but if there is a break you'll still see the 30K notification because it's a client side error. We'll see them a LOT less often, but they will still happen. Bad WiFi, bad internet - you know.

If a DGS goes down your game client will keep running as it's connected to the Replication Layer but nothing in the game will respond until you're reconnected to a DGS. The RL doesn't simulate the game world, it just keeps hold of the authority over your game client to keep it running.

Not exactly. Sorry to say.

30K's are a game client notification of game service authority disconnect. Yes, a DGS crash can cause a 30K, but there are other causes.

If there is a network disconnect anywhere between the Replication Layer and your game client for more than a specified period you'll still see a 30K notification.

But yeah, no more 'crash incoming!'

Struggling to understand what you mean here, are you using 'instance' in place of 'Shard'?

Speaking more broadly:

There will be multiple instances of the whole game universe called Shards. There will only be one version of a game location per shard, but each game location will exist on all shards. There won't be copies of game locations per Dedicated Game Server in a shard. Shard 1 will only have one Stanton system and one Pyro system. Shard 2 will have it's own Stanton and Pyro... and so on.

Each shard will have as many meshed servers as it requires per the player population in that shard. Dedicated Game Servers are only spun up for locations where the players are, there won't be empty DGS's spun up, many thousands of players per shard who can all interact via meshed DGS's on that shard. Obviously those parts of the game universe won't have anything happening in them if they aren't spun up on a DGS and that's why the backend simulation is running to make the whole game universe dynamically change over time even in places where there are no players.

As they progress toward Dynamic Server Meshing the number of shards can be reduced but real world signal travel time has some bearing on that. Dynamic Server Meshing is about a more cost efficient use of player servers which will become more population driven rather than game location driven, DSM reduces the need to spin up a game location on a Dedicated Game Server just because one player is present, rather than a location having a fixed game world boundary that boundary can expand or contract according to where the players are.

Taking the extreme example of 1 player in a shard:
If a player is in Stanton then there is a DGS spun up with the Stanton system it has static boundaries, it can only load the Stanton system. That is Static Server Meshing.

If the player wants to go to the Pyro system then another DGS has to be spun up that has Pyro on it so the player can move DGS to DGS to get to Pyro. The Stanton server is then spun down. You need to rent time on two DGS's.

With Dynamic Server Meshing the DGS holding Stanton can have it's boundaries dynamically extended to load Pyro onto the same server, the player goes to Pyro while on the same server. Stanton is then streamed out of that DGS using Server Object Container Streaming. You only need to rent time on one DGS with Dynamic Server Meshing for that player.

Quantum runs a virtual copy for each shard (some things will be copied across shards such as commodity prices etc) it's purpose is to simulate the places where players aren't. Quantum and the vNPC system are to put NPC's and the economy into each shard. Quantum and vNPC's won't be shard hopping at the granular level where players can encounter it directly.

So.. yes there will be thousands of players per shard once Static and Dynamic Server Meshing is in, as to whether there will ever be only one shard for all players that is dependent on solutions to real world signal travel time, so yes it's unlikely in the medium term, even with Dynamic Server Meshing it will remain regional shards for a good while yet. Dynamic Server Meshing is not an answer to signal travel time delay, it is the answer to making server meshing more cost efficient per player. If they can simulate a maximum of 1 million vNPC's on a server running the whole universe and it supplied all shards simultaneously with unique vNPC's then you'd have to divide the number of vNPC's by the number of running shards, it's easier to run 1 million vNPC's per shard since it just requires 1 running simulation server per shard. Players on one shard will not encounter vNPC's on another shard at all just like players on one shard can't encounter players on another shard. If there are 10 shards and 1 million vNPC's shared over all shards then 900,000 vNPC's are being simulated for players that they would never see on their shard.

UE doesn't come with persistence, so far Bethesda's Creation Engine and Starengine are the only major ones that support that feature
Creation Engine 2 doesn't come with any more Persistence than Skyrim V or any other game by Bethesda. Creation Engine, old or new, cannot make un-modded multiplayer games. The persistence comes from the game save stored locally on your hard drive, it is not shared persistence.

Creation Engine 2 uses cell technology just like other Bethesda games to put game content into an area. Imagine a honeycomb grid, the player walks on this grid. The honeycomb cell the player is in is populated by game content via RAM loading, the cells around the cell the player is in are loaded with lower LOD content and that lower LOD content doesn't get thread priority for physics they don't even rig the 3D meshes for characters at the lower LOD's only the top level LOD's are rigged for animation. You can see this in Skyrim V most notably with giants, windmills and waterfalls, they are static and un-animated until you are in the cell they occupy once the LOD's are swapped out. If Todd Howard knew that Creation Engine 2 had changed the way it loaded RAM he would be shouting it from the rooftops because he knows there is an army of modders out there who know the Creation Engine capabilities very well and they would be overjoyed to hear it.

RAM loading takes time so this process is prone to 'popping in' of game assets - this is why they don't have low level high speed over-ground traversal in Starfield, it's why you have an in-engine animated loading screen for flight to ground, once the single POV landing sequence is complete your ship is a static object just like a building or a dungeon. The space flight / space combat will (is seen to be) very basic compared to other games of the type. Starfield has fast travel just like other Bethesda games, it's just hidden behind the non-interactable loading animation.

This cell loading is also why they make single-player games because you can only top LOD load one cell the player is in, any cell another player is in will have less / lower LOD objects in it from the players point of view. The player thinks he is crouching in thick bush and can't be seen, meanwhile the other player sees no bushes around other players, only his own cells bushes. Star Citizen and Squadron 42 use Object Container Streaming for RAM loading, so they don't have this issue or limitations. StarEngine has the limitation that objects are less dense overall, but that is what Server Meshing is planned to fix.

UE5 looks nice but it has limitations, the sort of limitations that make it unusable for a Star Citizen type game. Nanite has a list of things it doesn't support, such as transparency / translucency (there is no light transport through any object rendered via Nanite) and there is no stereoscopic VR capability for Nanite rendered objects. It doesn't support complex UV's or 3D mesh rigging the way StarEngine does and you can only use one type of material preset - solid object.

The easiest way (in my view) to understand what Nanite is and how it works is to think of it as a simplifier and compression algorithm applied to a 3D object mesh, it's a down-detailed zip file of the 3D object. Once the Nanite algorithm is applied the 3D mesh is discarded from the point of view of the game build, you're only keeping the compressed simplified version of that object, only it's skin information. How each triangle on the skin is attached to the next triangle.

Nanite strips out a lot of the 3D mesh information, like bone attachment points, and only considers the positional relationship between triangles that make up the faces of that 3D mesh, it then applies a compression algorithm to that triangle relationship information to compress the information down to a smaller size for download and storage on a hard drive, and for loading into RAM.

This compressed file is searchable by the Nanite algorithm, the compressed file has a rigid structure to make it searchable. The Nanite renderer says to the file loaded on the hard drive, which triangles (parts of the skin) are in direct line of sight to the camera? Show me only those triangles by loading them into RAM / VRAM... ignore any triangles not in direct line of sight of the fixed camera position right now for this frame view... that's why they can't be deformed or be 'see through' because the algorithm has fixed relational data for each triangle and it doesn't account for any triangle not in view, they can only be scaled because the relationship information between each triangle can't change, it can only be calculated from the camera position data. This algorithm that uses the camera position data to plug into is the big selling point, the algorithm says if the camera is far away from the object then reduce the number of triangles and average them out, that's why any game that uses Nanite doesn't need multiple 3D meshes of the same object at different LOD's. It's also why you can't have two different views of the same triangles.

Nanite doesn't support any 3D object mesh that changes shape in engine, nothing with 3D mesh deformation - so no game characters / fauna or wavy flags, no deformable faces, complex hair stranding, clothes or bedsheets, no bendy bushes or trees, no glass objects - it only works for static non-animated solid objects. Nanite rendering is also restricted to 16 Million triangles on screen at any one time. Since a face, the thing texture is applied to is always 2 triangles at least that means 8 Million faces, it's great for close up narrow view of terrain and architecture, not so much for wide angle view open areas populated with 'life', you certainly can't use Nanite for things like waves on water. You might see those things in games made with UE5 but they won't have Nanite applied to them, those objects will use the standard rendering just like all modern game engines, including StarEngine, for threading and rendering.

TL:DR
Any game made with UE5 / Nanite will have to be made with standard 3D geometry for anything you want to see through or see light pass through, anything that moves and deforms via a character rig / bones or material preset and anything you want to see in stereoscopic VR. If someone does MOD Starfield they will have a big job making things persist for more than one player and they will need to have a heck-a-lot of RAM with a very fast access Hard Drive to load top level game objects into more than one cell both for multiplayer and single-player fast traversal over ground, if they can pull it off. How hard is all of that? Bethesda won't even try, they never have. Bethesda makes very good and engaging walking/running single player games with Creation Engine and Starfield is no different.

To say 'non-existent' suggests that it/they doesn't exist anywhere, but it does, we just can't see it.

The character rigs are extremely detailed, we've seen later work. I also got to see them during an office visit in 2016 and they were striking even then you could see each individual stitch, I'm sure they improved muchly since then.

I don't think the post(s) are meandering. Seems coherent to me, though I do recognise some of the talking points from certain echo-chambers that are predominantly negative historically.

Regarding:

Marketing Division - I agree they are out of touch with the community. They have been for many years in my opinion and I've been saying so for at least 7 years. Customer Service lacks direction, they are reactive, not pro-active in my view. It's also my view CIG don't seem to demonstrate the ability to extrapolate the ramifications of their player facing choices into the future, or 'read the crowd'.

Community Engagement - They have made mistakes... I doubt there is anyone, including them, who wouldn't say so. Having talked to Jared in person a little about this I can say that some have the wrong impression. They think that CIG staff aren't highly compartmentalised in the way they work, Jared assures me they are (he stated he has no idea above what the community knows about what is in Squadron 42 for example) and developers when they come on screen say they are not involved in, or aware of, other teams work where there is no cross-over.

Those who have the overall view (senior managers) have been speaking to us about that overall view less and less in the last 3 or 4 years, we have been locked into a 'patch watch' and 'tools watch' cycle and it has not allowed many newcomers to understand the whole aim of the project, it has shut down the dreamers in my opinion, those of us who started with nought but the dream speak a different language to those who haven't experienced it - most of whom wanted to be explorers, even if that meant exploring our imaginations.

When the director of Community Content wants to make a series of videos on a subject he isn't fully aware of the whole picture of current development, and plans change. I agree it doesn't look good when a part 2 is expected and a series they say we should expect gets only one episode - and even though I will be accused of white knighting here - when a group attempt something that has never been done before we might expect it not to wok out as we, or they, expected at the time they say it. Is it any wonder other game development studios don't do it this way?

Squadron 42 - I agree that Chris' decision to blanket 'spoiler' all Squadron 42 progress beyond barely decipherable progress reports to the average and the odd in game feature is not one I would agree with given the nature of this project and it's community, and I have made posts about this. However:

The OP makes assumptions and proceeds as though those assumptions are fact.

Some things in Squadron 42 may take time to adapt to multiplayer, how much time who knows, but many other things will not need to be adapted for multiplayer at all because they are made using the same tools and pipelines as the ones used for Star Citizen, it's the same game engine for both. You can't look at Squadron 42 as one big gooey mass, it is made of component parts and each should be assessed individually to make a determination as to whether they would need any adaptation, and how much. It renders an argument weak to generalise.

Another tacit assumption made by many is that Squadron 42 is like all other single-player FPS games, perhaps 6 - 10 hours gameplay in an 'on rails' environment you can't stray beyond - this is not so. You aren't going from mission to mission with maybe 20 or 30 lines of character dialogue between each mission where you are locked into a small space which is really a loading screen to do not much more than walk around and look at things until you are ready to click on the next mission task. It is not that type of game, time runs 'in real time' while you are playing the story parts, you'll do what you're supposed to do when you're supposed to do it... or else.

When you talk to the development team members in person the one aspect they keep emphasising is how huge / massive the game is, they aren't talking about game-space scale, they are talking about the sheer volume of gameplay content the player will engage in. The things you can and will be doing, the amount of choices you will be making. There is a whole backstory to your character you will play out which gives meaning to what you are doing for the rest of the games.

Even if you attempt a minimalist speed run it will take around 10 times longer to finish the game than the average AAA title... it is massive. The vertical slice shown took 1 hour and it is only a small section of that chapter and it was a minimal spoilers quick demo run-through, I know this for a fact, there were many other characters the player could have talked to and activities the player could (should) engage in. With one of the characters they show you meeting in the vertical slice it isn't the first time you meet them in that chapter, even though it looks like it is. That vertical slice speed-run was carefully set up because they would have revealed some key points of the plot of the first few chapters if they had shown the player doing all the things you could do. That chapter alone has more things for you to do than the average AAA FPS game.

When listening to those questioning how long it should take and how much it costs just ask yourself, compared to what? Which other game are they comparing this behemoth to and why do they think it is anywhere near comparable? If you just take the amount of game feature testing for ten average AAA games, you'll wonder how they did it all this fast and for so little. The word you will see being used to describe Squadron 42 Episode One most often will be 'Epic'.

Another assumption about Squadron 42 Episode 2 and 3 is that they would start from scratch again, common sense tells you this isn't so since the following episodes are a continuation of the player characters' story in the same game universe. They don't have to re-make ships, the flight model, uniforms, animations, the character creation pipeline, weapons, Render To Texture, DNA, in-game feature elements etc - indeed the only parts they have to make new for episodes 2 and 3 are character heads (using the existing pipelines), new locations and Mocap dialogue most of which wouldn't impact the PU hardly at all in terms of the manpower and resources needed.

Server Meshing - as others have pointed out before, the idea isn't new but it has not existed at this scale before. Coming up with an idea is the relatively easy part, making it fit into a live game of this scope is where the hard work is and since there is no precedent for it they have to fit these WIP pieces together as they go... and there is certainly no precedent for that. Server Meshing is not some standalone piece of work, it has to fit within a complex system of interacting parts like PES, the Replication Layer, the whole universe backend simulation that runs in parallel with the live game service alpha.

Since we have agreed that expressing an opinion is valid, it is my opinion that the OP doesn't seem to have a full picture of what Squadron 42 is or a complete overall view of what Star Citizen is planned to be. His conclusions about Episode Two and Three are erroneous and don't take account of work already done. You don't stop to 'pretty up' something while you are still deep in the bowels building it, which is why having a live alpha game release for a WIP game is so exceedingly rare.

The usual response to reminding those with a generally negative attitude that they keep discounting salient differences between this project and other game projects is to insist it's all fantasy, that it will never be finished because look at how long it is taking, that we have all been duped and anyone gainsaying their opinion is deluded and or acting out some version of Stockholm Syndrome. There is no discussion with that type of rationale, they keep insisting others look at the evidence but they won't reasonably consider the evidence presented to them. They don't seem to be aware of the limitations (and the ramifications of them) of other games and how CIG are blowing past those limitations. It is not unreasonable to point to feature development and say, this is new and never tried before certainly not on this scale. It is not unreasonable to ask someone to consider, perhaps this thing is way bigger than your imagination can comprehend, that problems are far harder to solve than you realise and that is it is more reasonable to assume because of this why it should take longer than you imagine it should take.

When CIG casually say they are going to do something, like building interiors in a massive open world MMO, those who have no idea how 'out there' such a thing is accept it just as casually as CIG present it, while those who might have some idea of how radical it is dismiss it as 'crazy', 'insane' and accuse CIG of wild scope creep... who cares, all that matters is... someone is going to try where others have historically insisted it is impossible!

if you don't know what the 'attachment problem' even is, how can you have a reasonably informed opinion on how and why CIG have chosen to solve it instead of the usual 'fake it to make it' approach found in all other games? If you don't care about those novel solutions and features, fine, there are many other games that leave those limitations in, there are plenty out there. If you don't care about pushing those bounds, if you're happy with those historic limitations then frankly this isn't the project for you and that is not a bad thing, enjoy what you enjoy, support what you want to support - just try to understand the aim of this project was to be different, and THIS IS the difference, time and the willingness to go back and rework until they/we get what we wanted is a part of the equation that makes it so different. If you need a publisher, if you need corporate imposed deadlines then go play those games that have them, have fun... come back later if you wish.

Consider:

There are posts telling CIG not to feature things too far out from inclusion in the game at CitizenCon. No long term goals featured that people have to wait long periods to see in the game.

There are posts complaining about the lack of current progress on certain features on ISC's.

These apparently conflicting requests sometimes come from the same people. Unless of course they just repeat information on ISC's, SCL's etc that they cover at CitizenCons.

They have to find content for both.. how do you square this circle?

People are interested in different aspects of game development, some like to see the process of asset creation, some like to see big enabling tech planning and execution, some like to see granular detail on feature development, some like to see deep dives on lore and world building... how to please everyone? The easiest way is to use the correct media for the type of information, some things fit better in monthly reports or Jump Points, web based Q&A's, some fit better on live streams, some are more suited to pre-recorded video shows... and some for live in-person presentations.

If a certain subject is your fascination then perhaps consider looking in the right place for it.

...and what position do you hold at CIG?

Perhaps a senior position at another game development company that does spaceflight combat even?

You see, there are a lot of posts about time estimates for required work from some sections of the community which when examined turn out to be using the POOMA method to calculate.

POOMA = Pulled out of my ass

This is the reason no one takes this kind of guff seriously.

You have no idea what is in the game apart from the revealed A list actors. What have you seen? A short vertical slice that took 1 hour to play through and didn't even take up all the possible options in that section of the game, it didn't even start at the very beginning of that chapter, and it ended long before the end of that chapter - that chapter alone has more events in it, and more things for the player to do, than some AAA games (Like COD Infinite Warfare for example)... and a trailer that tells you, you don't even start the game as a navy pilot.

Where are you in the trailer? Aboard a Javelin - why?. Does Captain McLaren sound like she's talking to a tourist? "I see you've applied to join the flight academy again". She knows you, knows your history. Of all the video we've been shown she and Old Man Colton are the only ones who don't refer to you by your rank. You're not there as a navy pilot, how are you going to become a navy pilot in time for your first posting aboard the Stanton? Why are you present to witness Admiral Bishop say "We will not lose this system" in a fight with the Vanduul, and then later in a different star system fighting mercenaries as a rookie pilot?

You have no idea how long it will take to complete the game. Do you even know that there is a game within the game that will take hours, it's where you do all your training? The average first person story driven triple A takes around 7 - 10 hours. Judging by what I've seen, an average player playing for 3 - 4 hours a day 4 - 5 days a week is going to take a couple of months to finish the game. If anyone is thinking to take the day off work to do a caffeine fueled red-eye playthrough, you won't even get through the first 2 chapters.

You have not much clue about the technical advancement that has gone into the game, even though we have a Roadmap and anyone could go out and find what the limitations of other games are compared to what CIG are doing... but why bother? You can just assume what you like and bang on about it. But then complain if people don't take the argument seriously.

I've been to 2 CitizenCons, BritizenCon 2016 and several BarCitizens, as well as one UK office visit - it is a place where you get to speak to the developers directly, how often does that happen with other games you play? Mostly about the information they have just given but also more detailed stuff, they can put it all into context. It's nice to be able to go into the game and be able to say, I met the guy who made that, he explained why they made it that way.

It's also a place where the team can speak to the players directly and that has an impact on their feeling about the project and it gives them ideas. It is as much of a motivational event for the team as it is for the community. Game developers don't very often get to meet those who play their games, almost certainly not while the game is being made, it changes their attitude to what they are doing now that they don't have to work in absolute secrecy all the time.

You find out things you don't find on video presentations, like how do they feel about working for CIG. They become real people, not just talking images on a screen.

Like trying to explain colour to someone blind from birth, you don't know what you don't know, when you attend these events, you see a little more, a little deeper. Asking questions online most feel ghosted, we're just a part of a crowd, when you ask in person you might not get the answer you want but at least you know they heard you. You can look them in the face, some of the attitudes and language we see directed at team members wouldn't happen if it was all face to face.

You listen to some who try to present an image of Chris and realise, he's just as much of a gamer big kid as the rest of us, he likes to see the costumes people make, the art they are inspired to make, and he talks about other games. He engages with people. When he says he's making the game he always dreamed about playing, that becomes clear when you meet him but each member of the team has their own personality and approach, some are outgoing and lively, some not as much. I've only ever met one team member I didn't like much, he left the company years ago. Generally people who meet Brian Chambers come away with a positive view of him and a respect for his years of experience, he talks to you as though you matter he takes the time to listen and explain things, you can see how he interacts with other members of the team, the same with Tony Zurovec, he is one smart cookie. Todd Papy has a sense of humour and is easy to talk to, just about anyone would be happy to have him as their boss. I've been to other conventions and such, at CIG events you don't get the impression they are there 'just to do a job'.

Producing games is an art form, which artist doesn't like to see others enjoying, engaging with and noticing the details of their labour?

The ship hype stuff doesn't get that much attention when you're actually there, and of course we get the collectibles and see the artistry and ingenuity of other members of the community. The events are full of 'personality's' both known and unknown, you get a bit of epeeing about ships they own and the size of their fleet. The talk isn't all about patch watching it's more about dreams for the future of the game, so that makes a nice change. You find our community (including CIG team members) is generally a tolerant, courteous, well informed, friendly (even generous) bunch nothing like what you see online. First and foremost, for most people who go it's a social thing they are just as keen to go to the after-party meet ups, CIG staff always attend them, you get to hear some gossip about personality's in the community, that sort of thing.

I you like formulaic repetitive teenage angst music, using whole verses of bordering irritatingly elongated vowels to fill time or express false sentiment, go right ahead. 3 words would have sufficed. He got NODs. He's seems to be pleased about it.

Who do I speak to about getting my time back and when does the urge to stop throwing something at the screen go away?

Todd Howard stood on a stage and announced Starfield in 2018 - 5 years ago. Did anyone think it would take another 5 years to arrive? No. The hype train doesn't usually start up it's engines until 18 - 12 months out.

CitizenCon is a mixture of both the informational presentations and the aspirational presentations. This community likes to know what is coming, what the longer term plans are and the majority accept the 'what' is more important than the 'when'. The average time from announcing a new feature or game location at CitizenCon to actually seeing it in game is about 2 years (I'm not talking about back end engineering here, we generally know that takes longer). Again, most know that.

The difference between Bethesda and CIG is that we get constant progress reports keeping those features at the forefront of peoples attention, so of course it seems longer. A watched pot and all that.

Whatever is presented at CitizenCon we know it won't change the overall development, those things would have happened, when they are going to happen, with or without a presentation at CitizenCon.

Those who just want to play a game might prefer the Bethesda approach to communication, those who are as much interested in the process of development as the final product prefer CIG's approach to communication - you pay your money you take your choice. If someone didn't know the nature of the project before they joined they weren't paying attention.

The whole point of this project was to aim for the best possible, not simply the best that can be done within a given timeframe and budget.

I don't see this as any type of argument, I don't follow the logic. Invent a different scenario based upon nothing, presume that scenario must be the case because we haven't heard anything recently to argue against the premise. Why would they even try to refute such a premise if they know they covered the subject, and they have no idea that someone might think up such a thing?

Why would they make such a huge change to their plans, the interview where Chris talked about it happened after all the main story elements were set in stone, ie after the 2015 mocap shoot. We all know they don't endlessly repeat information they've already given us, unless there is a change.

We know they expanded the original story of Squadron 42 both because Chris told us, and because the vertical slice mission is set in a star system that was a $4 million stretch goal - after the original Squadron 42 pitch on Kickstarter. Why would I assume they've taken stuff out while they've been busy adding more stuff?

How far do we go back? 1 year, 2 years? Should we doubt everything more than 2 years old if it's not in the game today, just to suit those who may have a generally negative view? Why not go the whole hog and just presume they've dropped Squadron 42 altogether, they haven't mentioned it in person for about 9 months. Plenty of time to change their minds.

How do we square such scepticism with the fact that Chris has told everyone that if they reach a certain part of Squadron 42 you get 'the badge' to own an F8C Lightning in the PU? Don't we assume that if that changed CIG might expect people to be disgruntled about it?

Struggling to see where such a notion might spring from: Those advertising posters in UEE Naval uniform in the alpha release of the game that say 'Service Guarantees Citizenship' might they not have been quietly taken out?

Absence of [recent] evidence is not evidence of absence. Conspiracy theories are just that, theories.

I recently learned that those who were noisily insisting for years that <a certain anticipated feature> had been dropped completely from the game were just plain wrong, and some of them saying it knew it was wrong even while they were insisting on it. Why do I know? Because it was them I got the evidence of it's continued development from. But hey, they could still have dropped it (again?) in the meantime, who knows? It's not a slam dunk.

Who should I trust? Some guy on the interwebz with a theory or Chris, and Erin who I also spoke to in person about what I mentioned above? I'll leave it to each to make up their own mind... only time will tell.

If the subject comes up I'll put my case to the best of my knowledge, let others make their case and the reader can decide.

This is my advice to anyone: If you get the opportunity go and ask them yourself if it matters to you more than the next ship you want to know about. They get pretty chatty in person and they seem to like it when someone doesn't ask the same questions for the 50th time that day. Pay attention to who you are talking to, the director of community content won't be able to tell whether or when the mech suit will make it into the game. You can find out a few things you thought must be a deep dark secret, turns out, they aren't they just never bothered to mention them publicly or they thought we already knew. Like, the Terra Nova system was going to be the first system in PU, and Terra Prime the first landing zone not Stanton, but they changed their minds when procedural planet tech became a reality, Stanton had more diversity to incrementally test the new tech - apparently. Courtesy of Jared... because I asked, what happened to all the work on Terra Prime?

It's been only 2 years since Tony Zurovec told everyone that virtual AI NPC's have a continuing history log attached to them, and that was the reason for having a running backend simulation of the game universe as well as the live game so that AI NPC's didn't just go into stasis when not spawned in on a DGS around players, why should players have any less in a game planned to have full persistence and character progression? What Chris, Erin and Tony have said consistently makes sense to me taking the aims of the project as a whole, what others might think makes less so.

You may have served your time for a crime, but that crime remains on your history log. Anytime you interact with the system, ATC for example, it is recorded on your history log. If you are scanned by security forces it goes on your history log. NPC's and players can access certain parts of history logs depending on the level of access they have, this isn't just a faction rating. Bounty hunters and the Advocacy can track you via your history log. Anyone in the game can decide if they don't like what they see on your history log they can deny you access to places and services. They just don't want your type around here.

When you play Squadron 42 you have a military history log, parts of that history go to your player log in the PU after you retire your character to the PU. When you undertake Advocacy missions currently in the PU you may notice Dully stipulates those with the requisite experience, of course right now it is assumed everyone has that experience, but once Squadron 42 comes out and the full reputation system goes into the PU, it will be limited to those with the relevant experience.

Things on your history log will determine what missions you can take, places you can go and even what equipment you will be allowed to legally own and use in UEE controlled areas. If you don't at least start Squadron 42 with a character you enter the PU as a civilian not a citizen. That will affect things you can do in the game. There are other ways to get citizenship but they are not easy, if you have a history of criminality on your history log it will be even harder or near impossible to get citizenship. There is no other other way to get ex-military status without starting Squadron 42. There are factions, like the Advocacy, where having a military history will be a benefit, there are factions (even if you've never interacted with them) who will be very suspicious of your military history, they may even attack you on sight because of it.

The UEE can revoke citizenship, for criminal history for example. When you leave the Klescher Rehab facility notice he (the guy on the tannoy system) calls you civilian, not citizen. There will be factions in the game who may not be criminal, but they just don't like the UEE, it is a militaristic empire run by an elite class (only Citizens can vote in UEE elections or stand for office, UEE citizens pay less tax to the UEE), and they see anyone wearing the uniform of the UEE as the jackboot of the UEE, they remember Anthony Tanaka.

It did add new things to do for those with the imagination to figure them out.

It did change the way we play, if you did a bunker mission before PES, if you went away and came back all the loot was gone, now it isn't. If you shot down a ship it de-spawned and you got nothing, now you can go loot it, and salvage it, whenever you're ready.

You don't think salvage was a significant add to game play this year? I think many might disagree with you. "..nobody is allowed to make money in the PU without combat being involved.", that's only for the salvage missions or those who want to engage in PvP, you can salvage ships anytime you find them, no-one needs to know you're there.

It does fit the sandbox genre, however where it goes beyond the sandbox MMO genre is the plan for the living breathing universe populated with active AI. As is usual for CIG they don't want to go with the standard form of AI and a faked background economy and lore they want to create a whole new type of AI and a universe that is self-sustaining and continually changing. Tony Zurovec explained it very well in his presentation, it's too expensive to keep tens of thousands of active goal orientated AI in live server memory and if they aren't in memory then they can't do anything - that is one of those hard facts of life you just can't ignore, data written on a hard drive doesn't change.

You can't manually script tens of thousands of NPC's unless they are all doing easily repeatable predictable behaviours - this would be the standard approach. How many games have free roam NPC's using their own vehicles and using public transport? Working toward their own goals? The current NPC's are running on legacy CryEngine logic via Subsumption, that's why they are static in a location, it's the same type of scripted NPC logic you find in all other games. Ironic isn't it? They want Star Citizen to be made like other games, yet the features of those games technology that remain in Star Citizen are their biggest source of complaint.

Sir Isaac Newton said "If I have seen further it is because I have stood on the shoulders of giants", while he was sarcastically mocking a rival scientist who was short in stature, it's still a truism, very little innovation comes all at once, it is a step by step process and hardly anyone could envision the changes Newton's work would have on the world, until it did. CIG are taking the step by step process.

Innovation takes time, frustrating, annoying and at times even boring though it may be it's the innovation that people will notice and remember. We have been through the content drought doldrums before while they work on underlying tech, we have heard people say they would never achieve what they plan, they still say it about things that are actually in the game - but they did achieve those things.

There's a reason other game studios don't do this type of stuff, venture capitalists, publishers and investors are even more susceptible to frustration, impatience and boredom than players.

We paid for, and signed up for, a different approach to game making, this is it, and there's no one else trying it at this scope and scale.

Those who use words like 'nothing', 'never', impossible' are only telling you the limit of their imagination. They aren't even being accurate about the current state of progress in many cases. They struggle to understand the difference between a locally stored game save on their hard drive giving the impression of persistence for a single player game and a massive cloud based game save of all the events in a whole game universe, and all the players in it.

They say they have the right to criticise and complain, which they do, but if they can't be accurate in their assessment of progress or understand why it has to be this way how much validity should we give their assessment of progress? Read through the comments on this thread, some are clearly not up to speed either with the aims of the project or even the current progress of it. They certainly don't seem to understand the limitations of the games they keep touting as better examples.

None of them have produced anything that benefits a single player, let alone advanced the player experience, and with such a negative attitude it's very unlikely they ever will. It's up to the individual who they choose to give their ear to - the builders building your house, or the guy at the gate telling them how to build a house when he hasn't seen the plans and has never so much as built a garden shed in his life.

If it frustrates some, if they can't wrap their head around why it has to be this way then surely it's best to just go play other games and come back periodically to see progress. Take some time to learn about the limitations of other games so that when they do see that progress they can understand the significance of it. Some just want 'a' game, but some of us wanted more... judging by the success of the project I'd say those who wanted more seem to be in the driving seat, if someone doesn't like where it's going, or it's not going fast enough for them they can get off the bus and walk around for a while, they're more than welcome to come back further down the line because unlike other games your ticket is a lifetime ticket to ride even if they upgrade the service.

Authority over all in game entities comes from the Replication Layer, they are working on that first. The Replication Layer was planned and designed exactly for the purpose of information sharing across DGS's and the Persistence Layer, as well as all other back end services.

The idea that you wouldn't hear any sound in space is erroneous, it's akin to hearing 'There's no gravity in space' of course there is, if there weren't why would moons go around planets and planets go around a star?

Why you would hear sound:

1. There's atmosphere in your ship, unless you remove it. There is atmosphere inside your helmet. Your ears are never directly next to the vacuum of space, unless you're dead in which case you wouldn't hear anything anyway.

2. When an explosion happens in space the explosive material expands as a gas and debris, inside the expanding gas shockwave is an 'atmosphere' which is reducing in density over time, it's the gasified molecules that the explosive was made of. Those expanding gas particles can/will impact the hull of a ship which causes vibration, that vibration is then passed to air in the ship and thus to your ears. In atmosphere the shockwave (sound wave) travels faster than the gas particles because being bigger those particles impact molecules in the air and lose momentum,, that momentum passes to the air molecules but in space the shockwave travels with the leading edge of the particles because those gas molecules aren't impacting anything. The shockwave will still impact any solid object and impart momentum to it, the amount depending on the density of particles inside the gas bubble and the cross-sectional area of the ship which is in a direct line of sight to those high velocity particles.

3. Solid objects, including high velocity engine trail particles, impacting the hull of a ship or helmet of a player will cause soundwaves inside the ship or the helmet because each action has an equal and opposite reaction. The sound you hear is the collision of the electrons of the object and impactor.

That is not to say this is exactly how it works in Star Citizen, because it is a game real world physics is simulated, but the idea that you wouldn't hear sound in space with explosions nearby, in the wash of an engine or with projectiles hitting things is not true while in a ship or in a helmet. You wouldn't hear the sound of objects / particles hitting anything else if separated by a vacuum, but you would hear them hitting anything you're inside of. What is unrealistic is having the sound travel at the same speed as the light, there should be a delay between seeing the explosion and hearing it, depending on how far away it is and the further away the more the sound should be muffled / lowered in frequency and volume.

I guess you missed the CIG communications regarding building interiors and underground infrastructure.

Also, they aren't waiting on Server Meshing to add Pyro.

I think it's referring to the holographic control consoles. We've seen still images of an example of them. iirc more related to engineering and systems management gameplay.

Heh heh.. got some cream? This burn is stinging mightily.

You'll be the guy to ask, Stuart must be asleep. What are we going to talk to our therapists about this coming Monday week? 21st.

I've checked all the national days CIG might be supporting, not much going on. Does anyone feel strongly about: National potato day, national mosquito day - a bit of a prickly subject. National Pecan pie day.. National soft ice cream day?

I'm sure we'll think of something.

Yep, the usual crowd in for their weekly echo-chamber shenannigins..

On a completely unrelated note...

Hey Stuart! How's Elite Dangerous coming along? Excited for the future? Haven't seen you in a long while, over here at least.

Oh...! the drama was just too irresistible and dragged you away from your intense gameplay and all those hot new feature discussions! eh?

Quick question, since you're hanging around with us for a bit - have they managed to get all two and half thousand of you lot onto one server yet? Do you find all those FDev community meet ups a bit samey like we do? Are all the old boys gonna be losing you to Starfield? Just think, an exciting new space game AND the opportunity for y'all to keep popping in and telling us how it should be done! Oh joy! Looking forward to it! Don't be a stranger.

Which magazine are we looking out for? C'mon spill the beanz - Kotaku again? Please... tell me it's not...Forbes!.. I couldn't stand the excitement! You'll get old Montoya really going with that!

Er.. just in case you hadn't noticed since you been away for a while an'all... it's ALL still here, going strong. How do they just keep on surviving all these dramas? You all work so hard!

Darn it!

No seriously.. welcome back to the land of the living, good to see ya old mate. For a while there I thought you might have given it all up!

[edit] In my excitement to see old friends I forgot to post on topic. I'm a Space Marshal, not currently subscribing, couldn't care less about PTU access waves. Having fun stuffing popcorn and watching others wet their knickers about it all, a little lite relief from the more serious stuff never hurt anyone.

They had one private investor in 2018 (a couple of years before they started regularly hitting the $100+ Million per year mark) who bought a minority 10% non-voting rights position for $46 Million, with an option to buy more shares (due to the company increasing in value), which strangely enough they took up... I wonder why if they were so anxious? $46 Million and no due diligence? Just as an aside to keep things in perspective, this same family business donated $107 million to South Africa's 'fight COVID' campaign in 2020, do they sound desperate for a few mil?

Who is this mysterious investor? It's the Calder family, father Clive and son Keith Calder (Snoot Entertainment) net worth $5.5 Billion. Made their fortune with record label companies and media distribution. You might know a few of their artists on the Jive record label: Britney Spears, Backstreet Boys, NSYNC to name a few. They specialise in marketing and distribution, indeed Sandi Gardner said the money was specifically ear-marked for the Squadron 42 marketing campaign to come. (Some of us remember Chris saying that no pre-release backer funds would be spent on marketing.) A quote echoed in the Forbes magazine article about the investment.

'Most' suggests multiple, there's only one and I don't see Forbes writing any articles about how the Calders feel about CIG buying into Turbulent and announcing it this year, do you? Or setting up bigger offices in the UK and Germany last year, and a new expanded office in Montreal before that. You can see how CIG are r.e.a.l.l.y struggling eh? If you actually bothered to look at CIG's financials you'd know they've already been paid a dividend on that investment, a tiny percentage of CIG's 2021 earnings. A sum significantly less than CIG's increased earnings for 2022 over 2021 (Around $26 Million increase). I wonder who's been helping them with all the marketing expertise?

Further to your point about trust.

When you catch someone in a lie, and you know they are pushing that lie frequently to try to make another party look bad, it's not hard to see who to trust.

When they keep saying to their hangers-on... Go ask about <this feature> and why CIG just dropped it after all that work, pushing it on every platform they have and even making it into a running joke at the other party's expense guaranteed to get upvotes every time it's mentioned, and you know for a fact that they know that isn't the case. Every 5 minutes we get someone primed to come and ask about it or hammer with ridicule anyone who says it's going to be in the game, or they want to see it in the game, it's a constant talking point in the circles they run, yet they know exactly what happened to it.

There isn't a better definition of FUD than deliberately misleading people, encouraging them to labour under a mis-apprehension for years when you've been holding onto good evidence to say the contrary. A simple line of text from the right person who frequents those circles would correct that mis-apprehension.

Here's the thing. We are limited in what we can talk about on Spectrum. Those who want to spread FUD use that fact to mislead. Those who are mislead think they are doing 'the good work' they've been charged and 'ginned up' to do.

Those who are responsible for spreading the FUD absolutely KNOW very well that the impression they are trying to give is not true because they have had access to sources of information for years that we can't talk about. I KNOW because I have seen some of those sources, I got them from them.

Did they feature that information on their Youtube channel or Discord dedicated to giving out information to everyone - no they didn't - I wonder why?

When they pass on information to Youtubers willing to spread unauthorised information do they include it all? No they don't. I wonder why?

Do they use the lack of moderation on a weekend or Reddit to give out the information that disproves their FUD the way they use it to spread their FUD? No they don't. I wonder why.

If you don't know what I'm talking about I suggest you go back to those whispering into your ear and ask them, why do you curate what information you know, have known, for years? Why don't you just give it all and let everyone decide?

You've more chance to find out that way than noise posting on Spectrum... but don't bet on it.

This is what I now KNOW - Squadron 42 E1 is going to be much better than I was expecting it to be. So... thanks.

This old chestnut again... sigh.. it is not two games, it is one game universe. Squadron 42 takes place in the same game universe, all the places, factions and assets come to the PU... even some of the characters may come to the PU. They are cross-connected. You play the same character in both if you choose to retire your character to the PU and there will be rewards and missions that go with having played Squadron 42. Things you gain in Squadron 42 transfer with you to the PU. It will be the same with the next episodes of Squadron 42 to follow, indeed any story they decide to tell in that game universe.

Why don't they have multiple strategies? The do, but ultimately they have to decide on one and focus on it, but be agile enough to re-plan - which they are. The Replication Layer is being separated from the DGS functions to facilitate moving forward with the plans for Pyro (and other star systems) while they work on Server Meshing. We have a released playable alpha even without Server Meshing.

These ideas don't come out of the blue, they look at known technology and think about what would be best for the game in the long term, something other game development companies don't have the luxury of. They inherited most of the R&D team from CryTek and a lot of the innovation is due to their continued work. Thy have also recruited very experienced people from Ubisoft, Bethesda and Sony Entertainment Division. The change from iCache came about because they looked at wider uses of customer databases in the computer technology industry. CIG can do this sort of wider-looking innovation because they are not locked into using a particular feature-locked engine which had to be stipulated at the start to be able to raise investor capital.

We will get building interiors and underground areas at a level of realism you don't find in games of this type because CIG don't lay off developers, and because there are no investors to say that we can't have them. Rockstar have taken hundreds of billions of dollars in sales of the GTA franchise and it's taken this long to get vehicle interiors fully modelled.

There are fall-backs if something doesn't work out. Chris could release a better version of a Starfield-type game with just the updated CryEngine they have now. The innovation doesn't slow development as much as people think, it is ongoing while they build the game - which is huge by the way. When you know that a standard game developer lays off teams once their part of a game is done in cost-cutting exercises you realise why Star Citizen is different, they don't do that they allow existing teams to look at innovation while the other teams continue their work, this allows feed-back between teams that otherwise wouldn't happen allowing continual improvement.

Yes, it's a different way of doing it, but we all wanted a different game experience, not just Chris Roberts. That's the whole point of this project and why it was directly funded by the players, not investors waiting for a return of profits that leech away funding for innovation.

You're not buying a game, you're buying the right to create unique characters who live their lives in this whole game universe, the clock starts ticking on this game universe when Squadron 42 Episode One is released and it never stops until the game universe is abandoned, and that won't be for many many years. It will be continually added to and improved, even better you don't have to keep paying for those improvements the way you do with other game releases.

Partially true but what you're alluding to... not necessarily.

Squadron 42 E2 and E3 will re-use a good deal of the assets from E1. The engine and tools won't need to be remade, there won't need to be re-modelling of existing main actors, many ships / vehicles have already been made and work flows have been refined to name but a few. Most of the new teams are allocated work for the PU and it's clear they are continuing to recruit.

I personally don't think that it is coincidence many new hires are coming from companies who have game products nearing completion, Bethesda for example. The advantage that CIG has over some companies is that they don't lay off teams when a game project goes through it's various phases because there is years worth of work still to come. In my estimation this would make CIG more attractive as a proposition to prospective recruits. I've heard this said by team members in person. They see more opportunity for advancement with CIG and that is a direct result of CIG having longer term plans.

This is not at all true. Jared has spoken of this many times and even in the last SCL.

Not only are they hiring teams for PU work, they are refining the tools and specifically designing tools to be easier to use for non-specialist game builders reducing the need for highly trained systems designers. As tools are finalised more and more team members will become proficient at using those tools.

Core tech pillars won't have to be remade and once completed existing assets made after them won't need any form of rework to work with those features, we've seen this with the ship pipeline ships and vehicles are being produced in a more finished state. The time they have taken to make those tools will shorten development time for future assets. They haven't just made tools for current usage those tools are designed for future planned assets as well, they have told us many times that pipelines are more streamlined and assets are being produced at a faster and faster pace. The amount of R&D required will gradually reduce.

Also we should not forget that work done on any version of Squadron 42 feeds into the PU. Those who insist that Squadron 42 assets will need years of work to come to the PU are frankly uninformed and most probably just deliberately spreading FUD. A great many assets that we don't know about and haven't seen are just waiting for core tech to be ready.

It's been a long time since I bothered shooting at anyone in the game, it's not because I'm a pacifist, it's because while they're changing things around I prefer to concentrate on skills for things they don't change like escape and evasion. I realise that won't help them testing but frankly I'd rather leave that to others since I'm 61 and now reflexes and eyesight aren't what they used to be. I also don't particularly like the message that some put out that you're automatically locked into fighting just because someone attacks you, it isn't true and we shouldn't give people the impression that it is. I played Ace Combat for hundreds of hours, but when they brought out Skies Unknown with it's arcadey 'mash buttons to enter dogfight mode' it killed it for me because it forced a particular type of play and tactics.

Having said that thinking about the actual game and it's differences between WWII style dogfighting a couple of things occur to me:

Combat is in space and gravity's / atmospheres that are different to Earth.

We have shields of varying abilities.

We 'should' have computers with advanced capabilities.

We have 6 degrees of freedom flight.

We have in-lore manufacturers of microtechnology.

My instinct is to do what @hcvertigo alludes to and view those making instructional videos and argument videos for changes referring to real world dogfighting, with dumbfire weapons, with scepticism.

One of the reasons for Congressional hearings on UAP's is given as UAP appear to have 6 degrees of freedom in atmosphere flight capabilites at acceleration rates which appear to defy / negate G forces. So frankly taking conventional aerial dogfighting and trying to extrapolate from that doesn't even work in the present day, and their military experts know that well enough to be worried about it.

In the game how would I do it?

I'd try to be realistic and just accept the facts. I'd make weapons and weapon classes that seek to negate some of those capabilities. I'd have area weapons that can both get into the targets probable path (flak) and do area damage to shields / armour. With the ship platforms we have in the game I see no reason why we can't have flak type weapons, targetted area weapons, on medium ships and heavy fighters / bombers with intelligent ammunition. This 'all projectiles are dumbfire' is anachronistic. I should be able to aim in the general direction of a target and let the ammunition guide itself to the target once in range, ballistics with short duration self guiding directional capability, lower fire rate and reduced damage compared to similar sized dumbfire projectiles. No-one needs a lead or lag pip on an anti-tank Javelin, you only need to specify the target selection. I'm fairly sure that microtechnology has improved by the 29th century to be able to allow that.

Directed energy weapons and dumbfire ballistics should be for precision strikes once you have sufficiently reduced your enemy's capability to resist attack and you can get in close enough to smell it's exhaust fumes. The aim is not to destroy but to remove their ability to fight back. In that case each weapon has a use case. If someone can fit all the same weapon on a ship and still come out victorious against a variety of targets the majority of the time, this in my view is neither realistic nor balanced. The weapon designers, defensive capability designers would have to be pretty unimaginative in the future if that were the case.

A good pilot should know when and where to use the capabilities of what they have chosen to load out with. Fighters as first strike works great if your opponents have little to no shields and thin metal coatings over sensitive areas and limited maneuvering capabilities, but if they don't have those limitations then the battle order should be reconsidered even in small scale, small ship encounters. Land forces know, you pound the enemy from range and only once you have reduced their fighting capability do you send in the troops for more precision. This is in my estimation why they have gotten themselves locked into this 'keep them close' even when the combatants have all teeth and claws intact rather unrealistic situation that they don't impose on capital to capital ship and land forces offensive behaviour. It's not 29th century dogfighting in space, it's 2nd century pointy blade fighting.

The play experience shouldn't be about fancy footwork, twitch and yank with all guns blazing it should be about intelligent platform and weapon selection and use of the tools you have at hand. In which case set your visual guides to suggest that. I wouldn't have lead and lag pips at all, I'd have the target reticle on what you choose to aim for and have a lock on indicator for dumbfire projectiles to tell you when the optimal time to fire is, then you use your ships capability and flight skills to get into the best position to give you the optimal position to fire with the weapon you selected to do the job. If you're using gimballed weapons put a converging indicator on helmet screen to show where your shots will go when you pull the trigger based upon what your ship is currently doing rather than trying to predict what the enemy is doing or going to do, leave that to the player. It is then purely skill based.

Defensive or counter-offensive weapons should equally be about selecting the right tool for the job at the right time. I find it very odd that fighting in space with 6DoF flight should entail firing counter-offensive always directly to the rear, even modern aircraft don't do that. I should be able to fire counter-offensives ahead of me, or in any direction, and have to learn to time it so that I don't fly into them. There's no air resistance in space and variable resistance depending on atmospheric density, the ships velocity should add to the velocity of the projectiles. I should be able to do what any octopus and squid has learned to do, put up a temporary screen so that it becomes a game of attrition and cat and mouse.

So you think CIG should survey every game package holder and have everyone fill out a form at point of sale for their health records and factor them into their game design plans? People die every day, sad, but a fact of life. The same could be said of any service offered to a customer. Build you a house you say, OK we'd better just knock a few bits of plywood together, you don't look well.

It's not a cogent argument to base a project on, there's nothing they can reasonably do about it. They're in the same boat, Chris isn't a young buck either.

Chris is doing the coding on this himself. He's writing code that allows each item to react individually rather than hit boxes. The hit registration will, if he's successful, be the surface of whatever item is struck.

Ha ha funny. I guess that's why all the successful politicians, media stars and trillionaires with their own close protection teams are so universally 'disrespected'. Or that a draft usually has exemptions for 'essential professions'. Oppenheimer never saw blood dripping from the pointy end of a Japanese bayonet, and yet they make movies about him. Haven't you noticed it's generally the young and lower in status and education level that tend to go off to war?

Hmm.. that old argument. What's that old saying? Something about the rubber meeting the road, or battle plans surviving contact?

Star Citizen was never pitched as having full planets to roam around prior to 2015, and no fly to ground loading screens in fact Chris repeatedly said it wouldn't happen - yet here we are. Do we pick the changes we like and call 'pwommisezzz' on the one's we don't like? Is that it?

The overall aim of the game always was about your character and your life in the verse, that you choose to live, with as much realism as they can put in.. you go to the gym, you get buff. I'm sure, because it's Chris, he'll put some limitations to stop mindless grinding, like no extra for crouching when there's no need to crouch. But yeah, there's exercise equipment in the game. I wonder if there'll be an obstacle course to run when you join the military? I hope so!

Those who take their Squadron 42 character into the PU are already going to have a very different experience of the verse than those who don't.

There'll be other choices for those who want to make them. I'm not going to be engaging in Roger Ramjet shenanigans much, I intend to be the sneaky-beaky James Bond / Ethan Hunt type who just happens to be a trillionaire hiring those with skillsets I don't particularly care to develop. Some want to be the head of their organisation, or some want to be an investigative journalist. This isn't like other games, there aren't any archaeologists in Tarkov, there aren't any Murray Cup Racing champions. Lewis Hamilton says he regularly pulls 8 or 9 G's in corners and he can do it because he has trained himself to do it because I suppose it's important to him. Me, I can get dizzy getting out of chair too fast but if you need medical attention I can guarantee you'd rather see me huffing and puffing round the corner than Lewis Hamilton.

Having no improvement even though you may have done certain actions over and over for many years doesn't reflect reality, and no matter how much you improve your personal skill, if the character performs the same under the same conditions whether you spent time improving a skill or not isn't realistic, otherwise why would we have training for anything, motor skills count just as much as experience.

The day they get easily affordable full haptic suits and 6DoF simulators for your gaming den they can make a game with no simulated physical skills improvement.

We know why. Those early destructible objects used damage states, sprites and decals which are laborious to create per item at scale. They switched to developing Maelstrom, which will also feature deformation and penetration not just destruction. As usual for CIG they tried the standard industry method, didn't like the limitations and so decided to create a whole new system.

What would be the point of laboriously creating damage states for thousands of in-game items when they know they are changing the whole damage system?

Physics are run on the servers CPU and those items in the video presentation don't just break they react to force and for the majority of the time since that demo physics was thread locked. We know they've worked on parallelization in the last few years.

Right now the servers are at max capacity in the PU... so you guessed it... what are we waiting for?

You have to pick your battles and optimise for your future intentions. They test things not according to just when they've done work on something but also when it's appropriate to test it - and in which environment.

Many talk about Star Citizen as though it was a released game with deficiencies and issues and the current state is the final intent - including you far too often. It isn't, and we know it isn't. Anyone who doesn't realise that just isn't keeping up.

Maelstrom, try to remember that word, it uses UV's to give every substance and material real world material properties - including heat damage.

This angst over iCache is misplaced. They wanted a system that made a hard disk stored state of entities in the game at regular intervals for Persistence. They made a first version, found that it didn't perform at scale as they hoped so they looked around for other solutions and found a better one, in another area of computer science, and adapted it. This is nothing new, it happens all the time in game development and indeed we only get to see it mentioned at all because CIG communicates details like this. They aren't going to rush to a camera every time they review something they plan for the game and we shouldn't expect them to. It's only assumed by those who hold a certain attitude that it somehow delayed the games' production - there is no evidence for that. All we need to know is whether the original intent for that system is still in place or not - It is... and it's in the game and working. If they hadn't changed the name and told us about it, you wouldn't have even noticed.

Extrapolating from this misplaced, and frankly uninformed, iCache dramallama to 'Are they still working on Quantum, Quasar and virtual AI population' - assuming because they don't talk about it every few minutes it must be abandoned, isn't realistic, we know Chris' overall aim for the game is to have a dynamic population and economy so no matter what they will try to continue making that happen. The 'how' we leave to them because they are the experts we expect to eventually deliver those capabilities... and frankly since there's no other game developer out there even coming close to promising such features, where you gonna go?

First - The role that iCache was to fulfill was never abandoned. It's upgraded successor that is fulfilling that role is in the game now.

Second - The current game doesn't have all the necessary features to make (much) implementation of Quantum worthwhile (they have input limited features of it into the current build for certain commodity prices and availability), ergo it wouldn't help testing at scale. PES is still being 'bedded in' and it is the focus of current testing. What would be the point of adding more to the backend network traffic that's just going to complicate seeing the remaining issues with PES?

When you see post after post: Fix the game! but where's this? Fix the game! but.. Add more of that of that stuff you promised to it! someone betrays the fact that they don't understand the process of feature development and testing in games in general, let alone in this hugely ambitious project. When a developer is doing R&D, especially while producing a live game environment, no-one with any real grasp of the subject should expect they will get every feature perfect on the very first try at that new, never been done before feature, it's not a realistic expectation.

I know people don't like to hear it but what we have IS an alpha test build and a huge amount of the features have never be done, or done this way as a whole before. You'll get them saying.. 'It's been done before in this game or that game!..' but never in this type of game or in combination. CIG are solving problems that most game developers of this type of game insisted for decades couldn't be solved. There are plenty of other features in development that are not appropriate for the current Alpha build testing, the DNA system for example, we don't panic about those.

This is buzzword FUD-spreading in my view, whether the OP knows it or not he's just soaking up bad information and repeating it because the emotion FUD-spreaders fuel and rely on is impatience, we all feel it at times, about many things.

iCache! Quantum! SataBall! Sandworm! - why aren't the FUD spreaders asking about the Spectrum? It will have just as much impact on the players' game experience, certainly more than any sandworm found in the Leir system or a SataBall game that takes place in star systems not currently in the Alpha. Why not ask about the PU Murray Cup racing tournament, we've been waiting for that since the project started and aside from an Arena Commander update we know absolutely nothing about that? - because it's not part of their buzzword lexicon.

There is absolutely no reason, and no evidence, to assume that Tony Zurovec's team has ceased work on anything they have previously shown - none. He's been working on it for years and they have talked about the improvements they have made over the time it has been developed.

When they show a ship being made do we say.. Oh that's hardly revolutionary! No, because we know that it's just them saying that thing we were going to make for you to use - here it is. it's just another in game feature ticked off the list to complete.

Player base building tools was something they said we would get eventually... and here they are showing us what they've made for us to use. It's as as simple as that. It isn't the new tool for them, it's the tool they said was going to be for us, they haven't finished the in game player useable UI yet (you heard him say 'Building Blocks' - that's the thing that makes in game UI's and HUD's) but we can see the functionality.

The fact that the asset library they have used for these UGF's was not being fully used is bye-the-bye and there will be more variety coming is nice to know.

They're adding player made bases functionality to the game... that's 'new' to us.

[edit] - Wait.. did some people think that simple asset placement tool was something the game designers have been waiting for to be able to make the game? That's hilarious!

As TMA-1 says, when you tie this into the functionality of the tractor beam and component placement whatever is in the library of assets that comes with the Rastar tool is up to you to use, he only showed is a UGF facility set of assets, there's a lot more it was a very long drop down list and he was only showing one category on that list. I know because I've visited their office back in 2016 and seen them using their version of the precedent for Rastar that they have multiple categories and sub-categories for their placeable asset library, far more than comes with the Skyrim Creation Kit for example, and that was back in 2016.

If you have your own landing pad/cargo elevator/storage area assets to place this will allow something they have talked about for years - but infrequently - commodity trading. Buy when the market price is low, hold onto to it in storage, sell when the market price is high. Farming, including livestock and live animal transport is coming to the game. How do you know hen the market is favourable and where? Well that's coming.

In the past they have also talked about how players will have their own mechanics (NPC's), upgrade and repair facilities.

There are other things coming to the game that they used to talk about years ago - player org meeting places and the Spectrum for example.

The Spectrum is the games in lore online communication platform (basically an internet) and source of information for players, it will have news shows and entertainment shows etc. If you check in the lore sections you'll see the names of some of those shows such as Showdown and Empire Report, they aren't just written blurb, they will be in the game, it's partly why they have worked on a tool to automate spoken speech to facial animation (just like FOIP) for NPC's, when you couple that with Render To Texture communications you can have 'live' shows generated from written scripts using a text to speech API which generates sound recordings without the need for voice actors. Something I've never seen in any other game was talked about in the directors commentary for the Squadron 42 vertical slice, they can have a 'live' simulation, fully rendered, of a location running even when no players are present in that location and stream it to any communication platform using Render To Texture. When you see the hologram call to the Stanton briefing room, listen to what Chris is saying in the directors commentary, that isn't just a pre-canned recording. Chris tells us, if the player goes to the location where that NPC is calling from they could photobomb that call.

Players and NPC's will be able to upload and live stream to the Spectrum. It's what the Reliant MAKO News Van is for, it is even supposed to have it's own editing suite so it's likely we'll get a ground based editing suite too. We've seen them use the in game editing suite in the last Jax McCleary adventures series.

When the Genesis Starliner was concepted it came with a whole set of brochures and lore, you'll be serving food and drinks to the passengers, but also pre-recorded entertainment. You'll have to buy those entertainment video series, and the NPC passengers will react to your service, including the entertainment. That same content will be available to players to view in their homes and bases, as well as aboard ship. As crazy as it sounds Star Citizen will have it's own version of Netflix and ESPN. Even crazier... they plan to have an NPC population who will pay attention to screens all around the game universe and react to the content they see on those screens. If you have a base you'll almost certainly want NPC's working for you at that location, if you don't provide what they need, what they want and what they prefer they won't want to work for you - they'll give you a bad rating as an employer.

If you get to meet developers, particularly the senior developers, and you ask them about the NPC's they get a bit of a grin on their face. You might expect that hired NPC's will always do what you expect them to do, but they won't always do that. Some of them, particularly if they aren't happy with you, will scam you, set traps for you. You might hire an NPC to work at your base full of supplies and commodities and while you're away they'll call their friends, disable the security and clean you out. Setting up a base won't simply be a case of looking at your credits and deciding, I'll stick a base here cos i can afford it. It'l be a lot more involved than that.

Again in the past, they said that the most valuable commodity players will be able to gather and trade is information, that incudes local knowledge. You'll have to find out which factions to align with, who can be trusted and who can't. In order to do this there will have to be some sort of scanning and mapping function open to players so that if you find 'something' you can either return to it or sell the scan data and coordinates to it. You'll need to pay attention to the reputation, history and goings on with the local population in your part of the verse. They plan to have a central information repository called the ARK which is in the Tayac system, you will buy and sell data to/from the ARK. But for things like trading commodities, factions and local knowledge you'll also get information about what is going on in the game universe and where from the Spectrum. You might ask yourself, what are other players going to stream to the Spectrum about - they can charge you credits for that content, mainly it will be local knowledge. Who are the main players in the area, who can you trust and who shouldn't you trust, where you can get things. If you just go blindly wandering into a system without checking out it first, you'll be at a significant disadvantage.

If you are unfamiliar with a star system, especially if you're hauling valuable cargo, you can spend hours checking it out before you go, or maybe the best thing you could do is hire a local player guide. Someone who knows the system intimately and can guide you through it or around it with the least fuss, most efficiently and safest way they know. How does that local expert guide let everyone know about their service? Put it on the Spectrum. If you want to provide the premier guide service, pick some base locations very carefully around that system that your customers can use relatively safely.

The Carrack has a command centre planned for the upper bridge, it's likely we'll have our own command centre facility for any bases we set up.

We used to be able to custom place items we owned in our hangars, the tractor beam tech has superseded that form of customisation, we've also been told that we will be able hang pictures and screens on our walls, the pictures are nice for decoration sure, but it's the screens that will provide more useful functionality for gameplay since they are your window into the whole game universe, this is what Render To Texture for communications is about, we will have cameras on different platforms - drones, ships, vehicles etc, not just on the mobiGlas.

What's coming is a far more populated and 'connected' game universe than what seems evident right now, so player bases won't be simply isolated locations from the game universe. Because of the missing features mentioned above it seems the game is just a 'jump in your ship and go see what you find' type of game, but in the future there will be more emphasis on preparing and planning before you jump into your cockpit seat.

iirc they said that beacon will demark areas belonging to a player, the difference being that outside of UEE controlled areas it won't be protected by UEE security forces - but you'll still probably get the trespassing' notice. you can set up your own security to be alerted or respond much like turrets do in some AI bases. So beacons will likely be tied into the new trespass system.

This a a feature of CIG communications, they tend to focus for a period of time on things that are connected by a common theme, although it's not easy to see that sometimes.

I don't think anyone outside of the CIG development team has a full and precisely correct handle on the exact details of how all the component parts fit together, least of all me - I just try to put my perspective so that others can add theirs and between us we can come to a broader understanding, that's why we have (interesting) discussions amongst ourselves to try and make sense of it all. You said you had read some of my posts, in which case you'll know I don't get into back and forth arguments, I just put my case / opinion, let others put their case/opinion and let the readers decide.

So what I'll do is let the Dev's speak for themselves and perhaps that will help clear up this contention about what the stages are for Pyro delivery and Server Meshing:

It is my opinion that it is very easy for anyone to lose track of what they are saying because the video was badly edited, it interrupted the flow of important information with waffle, loss of track and interruptions that should have been edited out, and 'showing the dev's as human' pieces. I'm not saying they shouldn't show us those things, they just shouldn't put them between important pieces of communication.

There is no simultaneity in this statement, all the language they are using is describing a sequential process, they aren't saying Pyro AND server meshing together, they specifically state they are separating the two goals in order to bring Pyro as the first step in the sequence. The Replication Layer is given as the only essential dependency for delivering Pyro Jump Gates because "when you actually do a jump to get to Pyro we have to transfer authority from the Stanton DGS to the Pyro DGS".. and.. "we're separating the actual jump gate stuff from the actual server meshing stuff". If Pyro came WITH server meshing then they wouldn't be 'separate' would they, so what's all the talk about separation for?

Since this was a planning session where previous roadmaps and ideas were reworked, any information given prior has now been superseded - ie all that previous talk of needing server meshing to handle transfer of players between star systems. When they say 'we can assure Pyro delivery, while we worry about server meshing - who interprets that as we'll also deliver server meshing while we worry about how to do it? To my mind no-one would make such an assumption unless they are struggling to understand English.

The exact details of what comes where, and the technicalities, those of us with the motivation to do it can join in the fun talking about that stuff, but the actual delivery of the features, the order in which they come because of dependencies is important to everyone - and the subject of this thread - not just the technically fascinated.

I simply can't understand why anyone didn't watch that video and know:
Pyro with the Jump Gates first with the separation of the Replication Layer to handle transfer of authority between DGS's.
Server Meshing, even though they are still working on it in the meantime, comes later.

You'll notice when he starts talking about this production method the use case scenario he envisions for this technique is for background, not for millimetre close up detail you can walk on, they look good from a distance. This type of technique is used for things like flight simulators where you aren't expected to be walking on the ground or even moving close to the ground except in manually made higher detail landing areas which are separate manually made 3D models placed in/on the planetary grid. Games like flight simulators use lower polygon meshes of blocks of flat (ie the grid is not curved around a sphere) terrain which are loaded in and out of memory as you fly across that terrain it gives the impression that you are flying around the planet as long as you have the hardware that can do it. This is called procedural production of 3D meshes, not in-game procedural generation. CIG dev's also use procedural production to make planetary 3D meshes.

The other technique is to manually make all highly detailed terrain surfaces, this is possible for maps with relatively small amounts of area. If you're developing a game and can have artists work on a 16x16km or even 32x32km for 6 - 8 years you can pour a lot of detail into them up to the limits of the hardware that runs that game, this would be impractical if you are making many planet sized 3D meshes... it's too labour intensive and also it would be too punishing on your PC's resources to create that amount of detail at the scale of planetary horizon to planetary horizon. 3D editors (MAYA, 3D Max, Blender etc) used to create 3D meshes use something called tessellation to increase detail on the 3D mesh surface, the higher the detail the more tessellation you need which increases the RAM size of the 3D model produced because it has more generated polygons - higher detail, more RAM, you also needed higher detailed textures (bigger VRAM load) to load onto those polygons and then you can make use of heightmap detail to create the impression of even more close up detail on the 3D mesh.

Some games, like the games Bethesda makes with Creation Engine - Skyrim V and the coming Starfield - use small hand made / procedurally produced terrain maps which they fit into a grid called cells. Imagine you are standing on a 2 dimensional honeycomb grid, the cell you are in is very detailed, the cells around that cell are less detailed - using lower LOD's, and so on out to distance.

Each cell in (unmodded) Skyrim V had a maximum memory load size of 3.99GB for all assets in that player occupied cell, the main limitation with this technique is that each cell is manually made and takes time to load into memory (RAM) as you move from cell to cell, this is why games that use this type of technology while they look very detailed close up don't allow you to travel at speed over terrain and they generally have medieval themes because of it - which is why you won't be flying your ship over the planet surfaces in Starfield, they don't even plan to have land vehicles to drive. If you do move at speed, usually because some modder has given the game that capability what you get is a lot of 'popping in' of assets as the cells you leave behind are streamed out of RAM and the cells ahead are loaded into RAM.

It's also why those types of games are generally single player games because rendering from multiple viewpoints (multiple cells) would be very expensive on RAM/VRAM loading. You would be seeing the other player in their cell standing in a sparsely populated less detailed area than the cell you were standing in, the other player thinks he's crouched down in dense grass and bushes because his cell is fully loaded on his machine, but you only see the grass and bushes in your cell, not his - of course he can't see your cells grass and bushes either only his grass and bushes. Star Citizen can be multiplayer because it doesn't have this problem, they don't use small cell RAM/VRAM loading.

In his presentation about Starfield Todd Howard explained how you will pick a place to land on a moon or planet from orbit, there will then be a fly down to planet loading screen while the landing cell area is loaded into RAM and the space area is unloaded from RAM - he called it 'procedurally placed'. This was the same technique Chris had planned back in 2012 you can see it in old Star citizen videos. You can then roam on foot and the cells are loaded/unloaded around you as move across the terrain so that you have the impression it is a whole planet to free roam about - as long as you don't go too fast or too high.

I'm sure that Bethesda has increased the cell memory load size and will take advantage of modern fast RAM, and cheaper larger sizes of RAM sticks as well as rapid access storage drives that will make for more detailed close in and overall terrain, but that single cell at a time RAM load time limitation still remains. This technique wouldn't work for Star Citizen where you can move at high speed, close to ground, in your highly detailed ships, all of the planet or moon 3D mesh is loaded into RAM at once and they use Object Container Streaming (rather than area streaming) and LOD's loaded into RAM to create detail as you all move around and every player sees exactly the same objects as you do.

The technique that Star Citizen currently uses is to have heightmap generated terrain in the 3D editor create a 3D mesh to increase the speed of planetary production, which is saved to the hard drive of their servers downloaded to your game files and loaded into the game, and then overlay those with manually made separate 3D rock formations (Objects within Object Containers) which are scattered and blended into the heightmap terrain which 'on the fly via your GPU adds surface detail to the procedurally produced planetary mesh. As you can see from the above video they are thinking about methods to increase scale and one technique he mentions in the video is to have heightmaps on top of heightmaps to build scale, this still suffers from the vertical stretching problem if you try to take it too far - but they are working on that. They simply don't have the option to do what other games do and manually make vertical terrain at the scale and volume they need to produce content for a multiplayer game.

The general rule is: You can have small and very detailed (single player) or you can have large and less detailed (multiplayer) this directly affects the type of gameplay you can engage in, you can't have both because of hardware limitations - but they are pushing the bounds of what they can do with very large and yet detailed multiplayer capable terrain.

If you could define what you mean by exploration we could start from there since it is a broad term.

It could mean just roaming around known places that you haven't been, you can 'explore' your back garden.

If however you are referring to exploration in the sense of new discovery of places that are unmapped then it has dependencies:

Jump point traversal and discovery - they have shown development work on Jump Points.

Life support for long range travel - it's on the Roadmap

Ships capable of mining / refining for refuelling, and refuelling ship to ship from ships with long range capability carrying fuel as cargo - already in the game and features of planned ships to come.

Radar, mapping and navigation - improved long range detection, scanning and navigation are on the Roadmap. They have concepted ships specifically for this purpose.

Wear and tear, aging and malfunctioning of ships and their component systems. Engineering gameplay - On the Roadmap and currently being implemented in the game.

Unexplored systems, or unexplored parts of known star systems - some are on the Roadmap: Pyro, Nyx and Odin systems are currently being worked on. There are likely more for Squadron 42, we just don't know, the idea that Squadron 42 only includes the Odin system is frankly preposterous. One Roadmap entry of note is called 'Outer System', which involves building out the outer fringes of the Odin system, if Squadron 42 was a POI to POI purely 'go here do this' game experience then why build out a whole outer system for the Odin system, why not just the places they intend to send you to? If they are going to those lengths for what was an add on system to the main story line then it's likely they'll develop other Squadron 42 systems to the same extent.

Content for unexplored systems such as flora, fauna and biomes including weather, space phenomena and their effects on ships systems, currently some are on the Roadmap others have been discussed in CIG video presentations (alien creatures and boids, solar flares and radiation, meteor storms) there are likely others for Squadron 42 etc we don't know about.

There are more features we could also count as dependencies for exploration gameplay, such as EVA traversal and use of ropes / tractor beams and even storage and cargo management, even medical gameplay and ships to support it but the above demonstrates the scope of development required to enable exploration at minimum level at least.

Talking about exploration gameplay specifically when all we have currently is the Stanton system - which is fully mapped according to lore - is a bit pointless, especially when the systems required for long range space traversal and mapping are still a work in progress. When you consider the above dependencies you realise they are talking about the capabilities for long range exploration all the time and a significant proportion of development resources are being devoted to it.

Is it coming? Considering it was one of the core elements spoken of from the very inception of the project and the fact that the majority voted it their most desired form of gameplay, and they have sold concept ships specifically for long range exploration I'd say they are well aware it would be considered a vital feature of the game to come.

Considering all the dependencies is it surprising that it is likely to be the one gameplay mechanic that will take the longest to develop? I haven't even mentioned all the backend systems currently being worked on required to make a multi-star system game.

I realise that the above answer won't satisfy some people, but to say nothing is being done for exploration gameplay or that they don't talk about it is somewhat disingenuous.

The more you post arrogantly telling everyone they are wrong the clearer it becomes that you seem to have problems understanding English and your technical understanding is limited - he's right, they clearly said the spawned damaged sections were placeholder.

We know Maelstrom is the name they have given to their new model for deformation and destructibility and it doesn't involve spawning in of objects, it's real time deformation with physical properties controlled by the UV's.

Perhaps you might consider dropping the attitude and developing a little humility.

We have mag stripping / filling to come as well as weapon stripping and cleaning. I believe they have talked about different types of ballistic ammo.

The camera being fixed to the players eye and actually looking down the gunsight was something Chris always wanted from the beginning, which of course meant they could allow players to hold and aim a weapon while looking around away from the direction of weapon aim, hence the combined first and third person rigging which was also always planned.

Having weapons as object containers made up of separate entities allows for weapon customisations. Different stocks, barrels, sights, magazines etc. It creates variety without the need to create multiple whole new 3D models of weapons just because of a slight variation.

The weapon interior being modelled taking up resources is not the huge drain on resources some seem to think it is because they have occlusion culling.

The bullet physicalisation also allows for real bullet physics according to location: destructible object density, atmospheric density, temperature, humidity / precipitation, wind, gravity, planetary spin etc. There's an old movie with Rock Hudson called Ice Station Zebra. One of the scenes has a US Marine say that a bullet travels just as fast at the north pole as anywhere else and the British Secret Service agent explains to him why this isn't true because of the cold denser air at the north pole and the change in Coriolis effect at that latitude. We have player controlled weapon sighting planned for the game.

Ship weapon convergence will likely be a feature players can control eventually because ship weapons will be used in a wide variety of environments.

Chris Roberts himself is changing the way hit point registration works, he's making the bounding box for each 3D model conform to the actual model (if you know how 3D models are made you'll know what the bounding box is) and so the collision physics of projectiles and the physical properties of the target will determine the damage done to whatever they actually collide with, they have talked about penetration, deformation, ricochets and fragmentation. This means if you shoot through a gap in a fence it won't do what other games do and have the bullet hit an invisible barrier, you'll actually be able to shoot through the gap.

We're still in Alpha with many things at tier 0 implementation. Talking about the years of development is not relevant because no-one has ever done things like this before, no-one knows how long it is all supposed to take this is R&D on the run at the coal face - and that's exactly why it had to be crowdfunded. Anyone who joined the project since Dec 23rd 2015 should know that this project will be in constant development, anyone who joined before that date should also know that CIG have put mechanisms in place to have an 'out' (even with a personal profit) and so it is up to each individual now to make a choice, ask yourself whether you want to support a project in continual development with constant iteration or leave. You can always come back later.

Those who keep harping on about the game being in permanent alpha think they are the majority, you're not, just about everyone now knows exactly what this project is and that is part of the reason it is so successful because people can always hope and dream for more than they would get from other game projects. We don't get streamers abandoning other games and coming to Star Citizen because they are bored of the other games, they come because they know they'll never be told.. 'That's it, that's all you're getting'. There's always more to talk about and look forward to... no limits.

Extrapolating from current performance limitations due to backend architecture is a little pointless... it's all going to change. Anyone who says they didn't want that level of detail and instead wanted the game earlier with less detail and features obviously weren't listening to their plans and thinking about the ramifications of what Chris and CIG said from the very beginning. None of it delayed production of the game because it was always the plan, it's the other stuff like spherical grid planets (and the knock on effects required to support them) and the backend architecture that have taken the time... and it was the community who demanded those features.

Some just don't like change. Makes you wonder why they are here in the first place.

There's no difference between CIG and any other game developer, it's just that with other games in development you never get to hear about those changes and the 'standard' game development cycle doesn't allow for much R&D while you build the game.

The whole point of the project was to do things differently... and they are.

I suggest people watch the video again, listen carefully. They originally planned to release Pyro with server meshing, they clearly state that is taking longer than expected and so Pyro (4.0) is to come before SM and they said they were hoping for 4.0 by the end of the year.

It is to do with communication between the Hybrid layer running on the DGS and the persistence layer. There's nothing you can do.

The hybrid layer is going to be replaced by the Replication Layer Gateway Service which won't run on DGS's.

We very often get someone coming into the forums saying how they'd like to see features of a new engine demo in the game. Those of us who've been around awhile know that from tech demo to actual use in a game generally takes a few years. We also know to look for what they don't show you.

PC's have finite resources, if you're using RAM or a CPU thread for one thing, it means you can't use that same thread or block of RAM for another thing at the same time. The video looks like a big open world, but is it really? Did you see them flying at speed over hundreds of kilometres per hour or did you see a fairly slow wheeled vehicle meandering around the same general area and what was in that area? Nothing but surface rock. No plants, trees, clouds, wildlife or even other vehicles. Did you notice there was a constant circular ridge on the horizon, just like you were in a big old crater? No sea with lapping waves reflecting the sky, or a flowing river and waterfall. No rain.

Let's take that Unreal Engine 5 demo for example, lot's of plants (dense jungle in fact) and a high detailed vehicle driving around a very small area slowly - no distant horizon, no other vehicles in the vicinity, certainly no close up view of a vehicle zooming down a long road flanked by dense jungle. No wildlife.

OK so what about the UE 5 demo showing the cave and the player(?) walking around and even flying over some of that terrain - Nanites! - notice there was a cave with high detailed statues? To a gamer that's a fascinating area to explore, to a game developer a cave is a chance to unload 'stuff' from RAM and load in more 'stuff', that's why the cave is so captivatingly detailed, so you don't run through it faster than they can load the next part into RAM. Notice the surrounding terrain wasn't nearly as detailed as the close up terrain? When the player exited the cave - much less detailed terrain to fly over. She wasn't flying close to the ground at around 10 feet or so.

I have no doubt that CIG will have tracks in the surface, but in order to do it they would have to unburden some of the RAM / GPU / CPU load because there is always a trade off.. that's why multiplayer games are generally less detailed normally because when you have multiple viewpoints all demanding their own level of detail from each point that resource load is increased markedly, one vehicle leaving track marks on a barren rock surface is nice, 20 - 30 or 40 vehicles all leaving track marks that persist is stupendous!

The day they release a massive open world you can fly over at 20 feet at 500m/s in a ship you can look out of through the windows and see 20 vehicles on the ground with windows onto detailed interiors and players running around in them, in any direction you care to look and see that same level of detail in a multiplayer game on UE 5 - at the same level of detail CIG can do now, yet alone what is to come, then I'll be impressed. I'm not holding my breath, it won't be for a good while. By the time it happens we'll have people come in the forum swooning over Unreal Engine 6 demo's.

Could you link your source for "Sq42 has been rewritten twice now" please - it's news to me. I know they made additions to the original plan for Squadron 42 but that was, and must have been, before summer of 2015 because that was when all the motion capture and dialogue were done at Imaginarium in London, so the story was pretty much set in stone by the end of 2015 because if they had AAA rated actors coming in for rewrites and new mocap I'm pretty sure we would know about it - we do get to see the yearly financials and Andy Serkis' Imaginarium studios are not exactly cheap to hire.

Dismissing StarEngine as merely 'CryEngine' is very disingenuous, even suggesting that StarEngine is just a re-badged Lumberyard is also disingenuous. The number of changes they have made are significant, and they are ongoing. Search Star Citizen Youtube for 'Teaching a character to walk' for example and you'll see a former CryTek R&D team senior team member who now works at Foundry 42 DE updating the engine to use the spherical planetary tech you don't find in either of the above engines mentioned. I'm fairly sure they don't have 64bit floating point precision, object container streaming, and they do use global illumination that Star Citizen / Squadron 42 doesn't use.

Something few realise yet many experience in the game is that they changed the way player commands are executed, you input a command, instead of that command being executed locally on the game client that command goes up to the server (currently) or the Replication Layer eventually where the command is executed and the resultant 'change state' that command causes is then sent out to each connected player to see simultaneously (or as near as can be gotten given ping rates). The 'lag' people report in the game is not player ping lag, it's server runtime / backend network bandwidth related.

If you watch the Squadron 42 vertical slice with directors commentary you'll hear Chris Roberts mention that they had to change the number of unique character animations supported by CryEngine / Lumberyard because they had blown past 32,000 in 2017 - and they haven't finished yet. For context the Skyrim Creation Kit which is a version of the Creation Engine toolkit they use to make Skyrim V and Fallout has a maximum of around 2,500 character animations.

Neither the current version of CryEngine nor Lumberyard can have you sit in a parked vehicle aboard another ship moving in atmosphere, let alone fire a projectile out the first vehicle, through the interior of the second vehicle out into the atmosphere and into another ship and another vehicle inside that ship to shoot it's occupants... not even in single player.

Someone did ask a question in the 'Ask A Dev' section of the forums about what changes had been made to the CryEngine /Lumberyard and the dev who responded listed them, he reached the word count limit and said that it was nowhere near an exhaustive list, just the ones he could think of at the time.

You'd have to dig to find the information about the following they have said on camera they are planning:

Destructible environments and objects in the game. With full persistence of that state of destruction.

Real time deformation of objects in the game - ships that warp and buckle, bent wings and landing gear for example. They also showed a field full of plants that bent and twisted when a player walked through them.

You're assuming Squadron 42 taking the majority of resources is somehow slowing the ATC rework, there's no evidence for that, in fact it's much more likely that the ATC rework is dependent on the changes to both persistence and server performance improvements - whether they come from server meshing or not. Other features that had work done in Squadron 42 first are coming to the PU soonâ¢ presumably they don't have dependencies on the backend services to come.

Absolutely, don't believe anything until you see it in the game, healthy skepticism is not a bad thing, however suggesting something is so for all to read - without evidence but merely on the assumption 'CIG bad' - is a different category. As a strategy it just won't work, we know that too. You can have any opinion you like but that shouldn't dominate your communication with the dev team or the community, there is a tried and tested method to get them to respond, and that definitely isn't it. It gives them the same impression as it does others in the community, you don't look like you want real answers, you're just here to vent your frustration. If you want them to treat you with respect, then behave respectfully and with self control.

You have to ask the right questions without prefacing it with opinion, if it's a burning issue for a significant proportion of the community encourage them to ask the right questions calmly and respectfully, they will address it we have plenty of opportunities to ask questions - even in person, it might not be the answer you wished for. They have in the past.

There are very good reasons to purchase multiple copies of Squadron 42.

You are creating a unique character in Squadron 42 with their own history, it is not like other single player FPS games where the character you play is fixed and named, endless playthroughs because nothing changes. There will be choices to make during the campaign and those choices have to be unique to your character history, you can't go back and change your character history by trying all the choices - you will be able to replay the combat sections to improve your score, probably in the combat training simulator (It's the one they use for Arena Commander), that simulator performance does not affect your characters history arc. If you want to replay the whole campaign to try different choices you have to start with a brand new character from the very beginning. In the early days Chris talked about selling extra character slots to existing game owners.

Each character you create can/will retire to the PU with all history, possessions and benefits they accrue in Squadron 42. From the perspective of the PU Squadron 42 will be the most massive Squadron that ever existed because there will be hundreds of thousands of Squadron members who all fought in the same place at the same time but each making a unique set of choices during that military service. Chris has done this (in a somewhat more limited fashion) in his other games. Wing Commander Prophecy, you can't change choices once made in the story elements and you can only replay combat sections of the game in the simulator. You can start the WCP game from the beginning with the same character, however, that wasn't his choice. Squadron 42 is not an 'on rails' game.

There will be effects on your ex-military PU character depending on what you did during your military service... the PU AI will know you! Some may be very happy with you because of Squadron 42 and what you did, some may not like you at all because of what you did with that character. That's why Squadron 42 has to be single player even though it takes place in the exact same universe as the PU - as Jared puts it 'Squadron 42 is basically one huge dynamic mission set inside the PU', it's set in recent history.

That's what Chris is referring to when he talks about going back into more exploits with YOUR characters that YOU created. You aren't paying to play a game, you're paying to create totally unique characters in this game universe and live out their lives, and that life includes Squadron 42. Your first experience of that 'alive' populated 'living breathing universe' will be in Squadron 42. The PU will likely remain unreleased until it is capable of taking all of that Squadron 42 universe because they are intimately connected.

Suggesting that CIG should drop Squadron 42 only shows that the person making that remark has no idea what Squadron 42 is and how it relates to your characters' life in the PU. You can create and play a character in the PU who never served in the military, but that character will have a very different experience of the PU than the one who did do military service.

Interesting, both combined. AI wingmen coming to the PU but also AI directing that fleet... that is what a player 'can do' and the AI crew can 'do anything the player can do'. Hmm...

I'm not sure I'd use the word 'failed', but yes, they switched to pCache (persistence Cache) where the database is hierarchical not sequential.

Why not 'failed'?
The system they were using for iCache was sequential database lookups, but what does that mean exactly?

As an example let's say Youtube are selling customer account information to a marketing agency who have a client that wants to sell cat litter. Youtube could supply a complete client list to the marketing agency who then run a search through that customer database for those who have cat videos in their subscribed feed. They start at Aardvarkian and go all the way through to Zwicky and each name that has the tag 'likes cat videos' is printed on a sequential list - all good they have a target marketing audience to blitz. However it's slow because you're not just searching the target, you're searching (and paying for!) non-target accounts too, fine if speed of look-ups is not essential.

When the entity list in the PU was small sequential look-ups didn't take so much time but as the player base increased and the number of in-game entities increased sequential look-ups became just too slow.

They went back to the world of customer databases and found a type which organised the database by hierarchical structure, no more requirement to sequential look-ups you can search by entity ID tag.

An example - not meant to reflect actual in-practise methodology.
Let's say they want to search the game space for all instances of a Custodian SMG. Instead of going through ID = Game universe, ID = planet - all planets ID = moon - all moons = ID = outpost - all outposts, all players, all local inventories and all shop inventories in a sequential top level (starting at Entity ID tag = game universe and down) search they can just search for ID-Custodian_SMG and they will only get back a list of all instances showing the stipulated level entity hierarchy that has that weapon as well as related information they stipulate according to hierarchy. Where they get a positive hit, all lower hierarchy information in the tree related to that ID is also collected.

Because the database is now hierarchical they can further refine the search by stipulating a higher level in the hierarchy - ie search all player entity ID's with Custodian SMG attached. Much faster and it also fits very well with the hierarchical structure of nested object containers - it's a better fit and it's significantly faster doing look-ups because you're not searching where the thing you want to find isn't. This is what all professionals in any discipline are trained to do - plan, evaluate and collect data, adapt and re-plan. They found a better tool for the job in the face of a changing situation and implemented it well before persistence went live. This in no way automatically means the switch to pCache delayed anything, other work could continue.

It's called creative thinking and adaptation to suit a changing environment - not failure.

Exactly so, that is what Quantum does. Each character has a set of personality traits assigned, they have needs (both based on the game economy and their own preferences) and wants, faction affiliations (politics) and a given set of resources to begin with. They are run via a set of equations with somewhat probabilistic outcomes in this virtual simulation which can simulate millions of them on these Quantum simulation servers because they don't have the computational overhead of simulating the real physicalised game universe.

They take 'change state' information from the running DGS's reporting to the persistence layer, and from Quasar (which inputs information about distribution of resources and the effects of them on the economy), and run these characters through the simulation at periodic intervals, thus the characters (as well as their locations in the game) change over time. They live a life and they die. Factions will fight each other and the resultant potential imbalances that brings, politics will go on, natural disasters will occur and all that will feed into the simulation.

What CIG plan is a 'living breathing universe' that goes on whether there are players there to see it or not. It is the reason for the complex backend systems they have designed. The game will be a simulation of the universe which includes Quantum and Quasar, just like any actions taken by players the events of the simulation are passed through the Replication Layer Gateway Service to the persistence layer, each spinning up Dedicated Game Server will query the persistence layer for the up to the second state of that simulated always running game universe.

Why is this important? - it's about hardware and how it works.
Nothing can change if it exists merely as information on a hard drive, dynamic change can only happen when a part of the game universe is loaded in RAM and processes run on that data, they call this 'change state information', so if the only time that a game location were loaded into RAM was when it was loaded onto a DGS then periods when no players were present in an area would result in that area being static, unchanging. This is not a living breathing universe.

It is exactly the same for AI characters all of whom will be unique, they can't 'do stuff' if they are only information held on a hard drive. The Quantum simulation is not merely an economy simulator, it runs a simulation of the whole game population. If you do watch the presentation by TZ he describes a character who is 'doing stuff', a pirate with his own history log. At some point that character is in a location which is being spun up on a DGS and so that simulated character is 'Instantiated' into the 'real game' as a game character where you could encounter him. When that DGS spins down that character goes back to the Quantum simulation to carry on his virtual life. The only reason to spin up DGS's with an area of the game physicalised is if there are players in that area to see it. If the game only changed things in areas where players were, and not where players aren't, then it wouldn't be a dynamic living breathing universe.

The game universe will not only have players affecting the game universe it will, as others have described in limited fashion, have a whole host of AI driven NPC's. Some will be workers responding to a dynamic economy, some will be military responding to events and some will even be politicians, media stars and sports stars as well as an elite class of the rich and shameless. You create a unique character in this universe and the intent is that you will live a life in this dynamic universe. You could win the Murray Cup Racing Tournament, or at least participate in it. You could be a news reporter with a Reliant MAKO News Van who goes around the verse reporting to the Spectrum. This is nothing like EvE Online.

What life you lead will be affected by:
Whether or not you chose to bring your Squadron 42 character to the PU after military retirement. You can gain citizenship without starting Squadron 42, but you will never get ex-military status without starting Squadron 42.
What actions you take and what affiliations with NPC political/criminal groups you engage in - your history log.
What happens in the wider dynamic universe.

Choosing not to start Squadron 42 and take that character into the PU will mean you start as a civilian and you have no military history log and property / expertise / or credentials (pilots license, security clearances etc) that goes with you into the PU. There is a misunderstanding for example that playing Squadron 42 to a certain level 'gives you' an F8C Lightning when you enter the PU - it doesn't, it gives you what Chris calls 'a badge' and Erin Roberts calls 'a licence' that allows you to own and operate the F8C Lightning legally within UEE controlled systems, you still have to pay for it but frontline military equipment capable of being a significant challenge to UEE security forces is limited by the UEE to those it trusts. You could obtain and operate an F8C illegally, but that runs the risk that it will be confiscated if you are caught by security forces.

There is a story that will be ongoing for the Star Citizen universe, the PU starts it's timeline (and never stops running) when the game is finally live, the timeline starts shortly after the events of Squadron 42 (all epsiodes). Squadron 42 will be the first experience of being in that universe timeline for your character, it is set inside the Star Citizen universe. The UEE does have an Imperator you can vote for, it does have a Senate and you can vote for your local Senator, and it will have some form of local to each star systems' choice of governance elections. These are not 'background flavour' you can only read about by going to some menu - these characters will exist in the game universe. Unaligned star systems are basically the wild west.

There are social strata in the Star Citizen / Squadron 42 universe. Characters, both player and NPC, will either be non-affiliated with the UEE - ie they have no legal status within the UEE. They can be civilians within the UEE or they can be citizens of the UEE. Each social strata will have an impact on the experience of players - for example civilians pay more federal tax than citizens, but they have other limitations. There are 3 ways to gain citizenship within the UEE:
Earn it by gaining a good reputation with the UEE and it's security forces - this will take time.
Buy it - it will be expensive.
Join the military or security forces - the only way to do that is by starting Squadron 42. Ergo, you joined up.

Citizenship can also be revoked by the UEE, for example if the character engages in criminal behaviour.

As well as the 'federal' UEE there are local (state) law systems in each star system, as well as local law enforcement and taxes. Again, remember this is an always live universe that changes whether there are players around to see it happen or not because of that always running background universe simulation. Star Citizen will have 'game masters' who can trigger events in this universe and the consequences of those events will roll out across the game universe, also it has never been stated that the Vanduul war reached any final resolution, so we expect it to be ongoing in the PU too.

In closing - you will have a character backstory, you can choose to have a military history log or merely a civilian history log when you enter the PU. The complex social strata of politics, wealth, media, sports, factions will also influence both each individual character and the wider game universe. Your navigation through this ever changing game universe with each character you create is totally up to you. You are but a player strutting your hour on the stage and then no more... until you create a new character.

Arena Commander and the simpods it runs in was originally developed as a military training simulator according to the lore of the Star Citizen universe. Those training simpods, and thus Arena Commander, are an integral part of Squadron 42, they have been since the very beginning.

Some of the language used by followers of the project, and to an extent CIG themselves, leads to misunderstandings about Squadron 42 - it is not a separate project. The events of Squadron 42 take place in the wider Star Citizen universe but in the recent past, as Jared described it ''Squadron 42 is basically one huge dynamic mission in the Star Citizen universe''.

Another misunderstanding is that Squadron 42 is like other first person games where the chapters have cutscenes and menu screens between them, this is not the case. When you enter the Squadron 42 game the clock starts running and it doesn't jump around, you can pause it to exit the game but when you resume you'll be back at the same time point. When they talk of 'scenes' in the game they are talking about specific events that you will be witness to where the camera control focuses on the main story character at that point but you can break out of them.

Also there is the Spectrum. It is like the internet, it is the means by which we are both informed and entertained. Some of the story elements will be delivered to screens within the game via the Spectrum, you won't have menu screens to read to find out what is going on and why things are happening... all that backstory, and much more, will be delivered via the Spectrum.

The Replication Layer has never been described as 'difficult' but as the most complex part of the remaining integrated plan. It is the part that has never been done before, server meshing in various forms has been done before.

Will it take longer than expected? Very probably, will they reassess the order in which the core pillars are implemented - they definitely have according to them.

Of course if it weren't a live released alpha no-one would know about any of this because this type of R&D is usually done in secret and it is certainly not unknown for game developers to do such R&D and then abandon it. Because of the stated aims and goals given out by public statements we can have the benefit that such features are much less likely to be abandoned, merely that new and novel ways of achieving those goals will be sought, this agility is what comes from being funded by a community just as interested (in the main) in those end goals as the developers are.

If someone was around pre-2016 and followed the project they would know that CIG have delivered a more expansive game and capabilities than was originally 'promised' - this is why the detractors keep yelling 'feature creep!'. you can't have it both ways, you can't accuse CIG of failing on promises while accusing them of massive scope creep. Make your mind up, which is it?

If you look around the game space you'll see banking terminals these are to facilitate features they have mooted over the years:
Item insurance
Cargo insurance
Ship insurance
Bank loans
Taxes related to place, status (non-citizens pay higher/more taxes) income and transfers of property on death

Since they are all tied into an overall economy rather than being some feature that allows an activity to seem to take place then it is not appropriate to incorporate them into the game while it is still in Alpha - being wiped and with bugs that affect the overall economy.

We have the character reset which has been refined to account for some of the issues we find in the Alpha and likely will get refined further. However it is a feature that is open to abuse so that care must be taken.

Painful though it seems they are in the testing phase and 'our' loss is thus their gain because they can collect metrics and observe behaviours.

You can't lose anything permanently that is attributed to your account until the game goes live and we must accept that the final live version is their primary concern as they work toward it, not how players feel today, but even so the possibility of loss has always been one of the tenets of the realism we can expect of the future finished product. What you lose and how you lose it will be up to you once all the systems are in place. There are mechanisms both now and to come in the future which allow replacement of items you have lost. A 'never lose a thing in your life' game is not in any way realistic, you will lose things - get used to the idea.

A little add to that - one of the founding members of CIG and current vice-chairman (also a board member of Turbulent), a long time friend of Chris, legal counsel to Ascendant Pictures a movie production company owned by Chris is a lawyer specialising in the area of media and entertainment production. I would think if anybody knew about copyright issues in the field it would be him.

Except that Squadron 42 is the Star Citizen universe, they are not separate entities as some seem to assume. There are no 'blackouts' on the Starmap. Everything that is in Squadron 42 comes to the PU.

I agree and have stated so in other threads that they are too draconian in their imposition of a blackout on information regarding Squadron 42. If this were a standalone title being worked on all well and good about spoilers, but it isn't and never was.

Not that it changes much I know but Chris did mention changes to Concierge in one of his last communications and it was also mentioned at recent-ish fan organised event in Germany.

We did get the extra game packages for those that qualified and we did get the collectible Chairmans Club Handbook as an exclusive.

I don't particularly care about Concierge rewards, but I do agree that when compared to referral rewards you have to raise an eyebrow. Those referral rewards do seem a tad over-generous, especially if you've spent signifi-bucks going through F5 trauma for years to get a Javelin and some recent convert from ED with all their existing viewers gets one in a matter of weeks for free (one guy went from zero to maxed referrals in 10 days!). As a marketing ploy it's genius, as a salute to those who have made a significant individual contribution - not so much.

There's something I don't understand - several of the top recruiters have maxed out their rewards and instead of offering to use the referral code of another (perhaps for a contribution to their Youtube channel?) they just keep going. I know, I know gaming the system and all that, I'm just intrigued that no-one has to my knowledge, why not do what Star Citizen Reddit does and throw all your channel subscribers into a referral code lottery? I haven't even seen any of them say.. hey I'm maxed out I'm going to use the code for my video editor / moderators for a while. Youtubers generally get rewards through their Youtube channel already.

Now if you consider guide rewards against referral rewards, there's a lot more hard graft in being a guide not least because they had to put in the time to learn it all in order to guide someone, and they don't have paying subscribers or Paypal donors.

As I say, I don't really care about rewards but there should be some apparent balance, fairness. There's no escaping the notion that rewards seem much more about perceived benefit to CIG than they are about recognising any level of commitment or contribution to the project by individual backers.

EDIT:
With the benefit of hindsight I would propose a different system, not multiple reward pathways but just one tiered reward system based upon points.

Tier 1 reward:
$50 in your personal account contributed 1point, or x number of referrals 1 point, or x number of guide hours 1point, or x number of IC reports submitted and confirmed 1 point, or x number of subscriber months 1 point - or a combination of all.

Once you reach a certain tier level / points level you get automatic entry to the Chairmans Club.

I think we're into that Alpha WIP/Tier 0/cost vs benefit formula that so few seem to take account of or understand.

If a bug or feature affects a minority (even if they are loud about it) then it's the long term goals of the project that take priority, and absolutely should. Resources are finite.

When people make videos about this stuff, no matter which side of the fence they are on and especially when they extrapolate Arena Commander flight/fight into the PU they always forget to make one thing clear. In Arena Commander the aim is to score high with kills, in the PU the aim is to stay alive. How you approach your particular 'win condition' has its effects in the skills and tactics you should learn.

I was invited by a friend, a well known Arena Commander veteran to join a team vs team fight. It was in the days of the small map Arena Commander. In the initial onrush I lost all weapons and 1 or 2 thrusters but half an hour later after watching them kill each other repeatedly and respawn I was still alive with no respawn because I wasn't playing their game. I had no interest in being top of the kill board. They kept saying 'How are you still alive!'

In the past several years, with periods of random attack griefing at it's peak I haven't used my guns once and I always fly the stock loadout for each ship. I've been 'killed' about 3 or 4 times and each time it was because I wasn't concentrating (setting up controls etc) or not even in the cockpit seat. I don't count destruction from collision with invisible or random unavoidable objects. I've been pulled out of QT lot's of times and I always get away because I prepare before I start the QT.

There are easy skills to learn that minimise the potential for being attacked, one of the main skills being to simply have the patience to consider all options rather than become fixated, and fairly easy skills to learn to escape and evade (at least long enough to call for assistance) so while I'm quite happy for the pew pew veterans to have their input taken into consideration by CIG I do bemoan this attitude that all 'non-fighters' are somehow only lambs to the slaughter in Star Citizen - they most certainly are not. Not including those skills in the 'easy to learn, hard to master' skillset requirement is in my view short-sighted and overly narrow focused. It's also worth noting, you can't kill anyone if you're already dead, and the fastest way to get dead is to have the attitude that you'd rather die than be slightly inconvenienced. This narrow focus on weapon balancing and the flight model gives people the wrong impression.

I will watch what happens with master-modes with interest and I will have my input if they make escape and evade either significantly more difficult or near impossible.

When you choose your ship and activity it is up to you to be aware of the potential weak points in your use strategy and to learn to ameliorate those risks as much as possible, leaping without looking first is the primary cause of death - not griefing, not elite light fighter pilots, not weaknesses in the flight model, not weapon imbalance.

If I can survive, using every type of 'non-fighter' ship without firing a weapon for years exactly how is the 'light fighter meta' the dominant force in the PU game? Finding alternate strategies to 'Someone shot at me! I must put all my concentration and resources into shooting back!' is only going to get easier as the game gets more fleshed out.

There are no 'cut-scenes' for Squadron 42. There are times during gameplay where the camera is focused on NPC actors or remote to view a scene in progress, but you can break out of it. There are Spectrum videos you will watch on in-game screens... but no cut-scenes.

This is a value judgement, while there are those who may share your attitude it doesn't accurately reflect what is happening.

A game is like a jigsaw puzzle, there's no way for anyone to make a full judgement on it until all the pieces are in.

The second part of your argument is that it is taking too long. Again a value judgement but based upon what? How other games are made? The majority of games are made behind locked doors and no-one gets to even hear about them until they are in the feature complete stage. Even when they reveal a game they virtually never detail all the R&D that went into making the game engine that produced that game.

Let's take Starfield as an example. They are using Creation Engine 2, a revised and hopefully updated version of Creation Engine which itself was based on the Gamebryo engine which by the time they wanted to make Skyrim V they felt was outdated. The Creation Engine began development around 2011.

Bethesda don't, and likely won't, talk about any adjunct tools they have developed to make Starfield - so that is an unknown.

Listening carefully to Todd Howard's presentation on Starfield I was listening to hear how they had updated Creation Engine because I have used it to make Skyrim V mods, I know it's capabilities and limitations (somewhat). The only new feature he mentioned, proud as he was of the work his team had done, was that now NPC's can use ladders. Yes that's definitely different to Skyrim V.

You want 'a game' but seem oblivious to what needs to be done to actually make a game. The amount of R&D that CIG has done is quite frankly phenomenal in the time when compared to other game engines, they have tackled problems that other studios don't even dare to attempt because the plan is to make a game on a scale, and yet at an FPS level usually only for 'small map games' , that is what other game developers would call 'daunting'. The reason they can do that is because of the unique partnership they have made with a community to develop a funding model that otherwise would not support that amount of R&D.

So how long should it take? No-one knows, not even CIG because it has never been done this way before. There is nothing to make a comparison to. The whole point of the project was to make the end goal paramount rather than producing a known product to satisfy a bunch of investors simply looking to make a profit.

Star Citizen was from inception intended to be a co-partnership between game developers and their gaming community, something never attempted by any game developer and outside of a few niche indy projects it has never been done this way before.

It's not finished yet, it's not even feature complete yet, indeed many of the tools they need to make it all a reality are still in development (refinement) and many many times over the last 10 years people have told them they would never be able to do the things they plan to do - yet they have done those things. Yes, sometimes it took longer than they, or we, hoped but the point is - they have done it. It's very hard to see how all the the things fit together to make that whole jigsaw puzzle a reality, especially if you have little to no inside knowledge of the way things are usually done.

The game is not 'broken' because you can only apply such a term to finished released game. Star Citizen is still being built piece by piece with many pieces yet to go in and one of the main draws for many to this project is that we get to see all the processes that go into making this puzzle fit together, see how the sausage gets made.

You don't have to stay to watch it, but whatever you decide you and anyone else is welcome to come and enjoy the fruits of all that labour, and community patience, when it does finally come together.

If you want to be pedantic, then Starfield has been at the very least 12 years in development and it still doesn't have some of the capabilities that this 'broken alpha' has right now, and unless there are some truly heroic modders out there, it never will. Todd Howard in his Starfield presentation acknowledged the input (thus work) from years of people modding Bethesda games and we know some of those advances will feature in Starfield... they used them in their Skyrim V VR release as well.

Me also, far too much favouritism. Lot's of 'maybe'.

Yes. I also think they over-promised interaction with the community because they didn't realise how big it would become. Chris has stated as much several times.

Yes. They were a lot more optimistic and happy to theory craft.

How I feel about Chris is best explained from my own professional career.
As a registered nurse working in a very busy Accident and Emergency department we would be rushed off our feet for 12 hours straight sometimes, no breaks and literally running from patient to patient meanwhile the waiting area was full of people who had waited hours to be seen, uncomfortable, worried and in the main just needing some reassurance that we would take care of them before they got to the stage it was all too much. They have no idea of the work being done behind closed doors. I can't clear a bed because I'm waiting on this X-Ray to be done, the other patients lab tests to come back for doctors review. They would come in and be snappy, or even downright angry with the nursing staff, of course we can't detail all the work and patients we'd seen in the hours they waited - professional confidentiality - so we offer sympathy, we understand how they feel but we can't do any more than we are doing, and offer platitudes along with a plan to fix their issue at a speed commensurate with the new people waiting behind them.

I could take 10 or 15 minutes to get another nurse to look after my patients, quick handover of important details go out to the waiting area and offer reassurances we'll get to you as soon as we can - but in about 2 or 3 hours there's gonna be a new set of people waiting.

This is the way I think it is with Chris, long hour days (Sandi has remarked on his habit of coding late into the night), pushing pushing pushing and not noticing the time pass with all of us in the waiting area getting impatient frustrated and even angry. He has the best of intentions and it is important to him to maintain his integrity with the community and do his 'duty'. In his mind I'm sure he feels if he just keeps going it will be soon that he can reveal all and silence the detractors, his head always full of the details and problems at hand...

...but that clock just keeps on ticking and more and more new people are coming in soaking up the sour mood in the waiting area. Clever guys, 'influencers with experience' know you only have to plant a couple of noisy complainers in the waiting area and that sour mood spreads like wildfire.

I remember we had interesting discussions about the plans for the game - Death of a Spaceman for example. Different worlds and biomes shown off by CIG, the stuff shown off in the Subscriber Vault now dismissed (by CIG staff) as merely 'concept art'. It's not an accident that one of the few polls by CIG overwhelmingly showed the majority of backers wanted to be explorers, because we spent all our time pawing over images of 'other worlds' prior to 2016 and all we had to fly in was Arena Commander. In the days when CIG had less than a 100th of the money they paid concept artists to make that stuff in the vault. Why? Why was that a priority? It was made when all there was was the Squadron 42 universe to come, but no-one can post discussion of any of it, or ask why the radio silence on it, because they'll get pounced on and thread-locked by those with the perma-negative jaded attitude and told it's old and abandoned - no it isn't - the story for Squadron 42 hasn't changed only expanded.

Common sense tells you the story of Squadron 42 Ep 1, including all the locations in it, was written in stone by the end of 2015 when the mocap at the Imaginarium studios was wrapped. If they had main actors coming back for story change mocap WE'D KNOW ABOUT IT. ..and yet those who insist Chris is "The scope-creep king" mad on making a playable detailed movie is going to throw out large sections of all that expensive mocap and dialogue? Utter nonsense.

I remember there was good humoured banter, particularly when the Concierge section of the forums opened.

I remember how it was people in the community who insisted that money raised from selling ships and game packages should only go to making the game and CIG should offer a voluntary subscription for producing informative shows like Wingmans Hangar etc. Which they did. Of course that lead to a lot of discussion about subscriber perks.

There was always new information to discuss and mull over and it never occurred to anyone that large portions of the game development would be behind a spoiler wall one day - that came around late 2016 / 2017 and I think that is the cause of a lot of peoples frustrations because the dreaming part was now essentially over a community of majority dreamer explorers corralled in one star system for years which they can't even dream themselves out of anymore, from then on it was merely patch watching and tool-splaining - it's what feeds the content hungry Youtubers 'Star Citizen News!' on a regular basis. Our promised universe shrunk to Stanton with a bit of Pyro and Nyx occasionally, and Odin in a blink and you'll miss it fashion. They used to talk about other star systems all the time, they showed Leir III at CitizenCon and never spoke of it again. The very first player traversable landing zone they showed was Terra Prime.

Squadron 42 IS the bulk of the Star Citizen universe and the rather silly notion that some have fixed in their minds that this epic space war saga will be set in one or two star systems is simply incredulous, there would be uproar if that were the case and very well Chris knows it. He's on record saying the Squadron 42 story was expanded (from the original Kickstarter pitch) prior to 2015 and we know that is the case because the Odin system was a $4 Million dollar stretch goal 'extra system' long after the Kickstarter and he actually says in the directors commentary that the vertical slice is a side mission (an addition) not part of the main story arc - but it's no wonder, because CIG brought the curtain down... no more 'peeking under Chris Roberts skirt'.

Going dead silent on Squadron 42 is in my estimation THE biggest mistake they have made it was Chris' arbitrary decision to go silent on Squadron 42 related content that killed discussion of exploration and you only have to look at the forum today to see it, it completely broke the faith in an open dialogue between CIG and the community for many veterans of the project, it absolutely doesn't 'treat us like producers' in any fashion. If Todd Howard can tell everyone who hasn't paid a penny for it to be developed how many star systems are in Starfield without it being a spoiler then I'm sure the one's who paid to have Squadron 42 made have an unassailable right to ask - How big is this Squadron 42 universe that has taken 10 years to make? They were quite happy giving teaser plot spoilers before 2017 (even if only for side missions) but basic metrics? We know the Vanduul War starts with the attack on Vega, we know we start as a rookie pilot and the only UEE Naval Flight Academy is in the Kilian system - it wouldn't be a shock to acknowledge they at least are in Squadron 42, what part of the plot would he be giving away that we don't already know? Do people honestly believe they've paid a linguist to create alien languages for worlds we'll never visit?

I find it disappointing that Chris has got so deep into the weeds he's forgotten what this community is yearning for, surely it can't be beyond him to find ways to fire that imagination again without giving plot spoilers?

What I don't remember prior to Spectrum is numerous troll threads sort-by-new snow-storming of the general section, brigading and clannish behaviour, weekends and holidays full of pure shit stirring. We can't discuss reasonable questions,let alone some good old fun theory crafting, because they just get derailed and trolled so most stopped trying - which frankly was the intent of the trolls. Moderation was rare and done voluntarily, with sensitivity, even on weekends and holidays! There was certainly favouritism shown by senior producers of CIG media content but when we pointed it out it stopped - you'll notice that when a question is read out now the name/handle of the person putting the question isn't read out - it used to be.

Here's the irony, some of the biggest movers and shakers in the early backer community (the original dreamers) who were on average 29 times more likely to get their questions answered by Wingmans Hangar and 10FTC (we did the research and the maths) are now the biggest detractors organising the trolling of the project, and they are not fools, they organise well, they recruit very well and they know how to get a message across. Sandi Roberts called them 'snowflakes' on an episode of Astropub... and they were, they expected to be able to email company directors directly and even turn up at the offices unannounced. They're not gone, they just use alt accounts. What looks like a lot of upvotes for 'subject-less' negativity only appears so. They have no intention of getting answers, they never ask the right questions. They've made their minds up and now they just want to sour the milk for everyone else.

That's not to say there aren't those who are bona fide unhappy with the length of time it is taking or about decisions CIG have taken, there are plenty. I'm not happy about them abandoning the core tenets of Death of a Spaceman or their change in attitude to communicating with the community post 2016, but those who feel that way tend to just quietly go away in the main. We've lost a lot of good characters who spent time in the forums helping others get up to speed with wit and humour and the new folks coming along have lost access to a lot of good historical knowledge about the project in a broad overview 'original intent of the project' fashion because of it... again that was intentional, and in my view it's the second mistake CIG have made.. allowing the community to be manipulated like that by a small group of disgruntled disaffected "snowflakes".

You have to draw the line somewhere, hand-made bespoke everything would take far too long - it's not feasible.

The lore of the Rest and Relax franchise is that they make modular stations 'on the cheap' so the OP is right, R&R edged out the competition in the UEE.

There will be other style stations, the Pyro stations will be different to the Stanton system and of course we have the non-UEE alien systems to come.

Extrapolating from the current Stanton system, which isn't even complete yet the Aaron Halo stations look totally different, is not going to give you the rest of the verse. While they'll keep the modularity they'll have style guides for other franchises, Stanton is just the first and they've filled it with what is quickest to make it functional.

People think that what we see currently is all there is, I know this isn't true, they've done work that is behind locked 'spoiler' doors - they've been doing it for years. We only get to see and experience a fraction of what they've made.

It strains my credulity that there are those who think, and even insist, that all the events of the Squadron 42 Ep 1 space saga happen in the Odin system - Seriously? Who on Earth would tolerate that after a decade of work on it? Can you imagine the uproar if it were so, a whole space war saga set in only one star system! Common sense tells us that absolutely cannot be the case.

We know the Squadron 42 Ep 1 story was expanded prior to 2015 because:
1. Chris said it was expanded.
2. The Odin system was an addon system for the $4 Million stretch goal so it can't have been part of the original Squadron 42 story arc pitch. Chris actually says in the Squadron 42 vertical slice with directors commentary that the events in the Odin system are a side mission, not part of the main story arc.

The whole Ep 1 story is about the Vanduul invasion of Vega - we are absolutely going to the Vega system. In the first post-kickstarter video showing events from Squadron 42 Captain McClaren speaks to the camera (the player) and says "I see you've applied to the flight academy again". The UEE Naval Flight Academy is in the Kilian system and we know from the vertical slice that we start as a rookie pilot. In the vertical slice video with directors commentary it shows the Stanton arriving in the Odin system and Chris says the events in the Odin system are about 1/3rd of the way into Squadron 42 Ep 1. It also takes place before the Vanduul attack on Vega.

Ha ha.. OK I'll bite.

Well to be fair we did give the USA computers, telephony, radar and the jet engine design - we also gave them a lot of British scientists who went off to join NASA (back here they called it 'the brain drain').. but ho hum.

Will Star Citizen spend most of it's time in the repair shop? First it has to get out of the factory where it is being built and as I said the more prestigious the design the longer it takes.

Players will log into the Replication Layer Gateway Service (see diagram) all commands and actions taken by players will then be passed from the RLGS to each DGS (the purple round smudges) where a virtual copy of your game physicalised avatar will be represented as responding to those command inputs - it's a replication of the simulation. You can clearly see from the diagram no player directly connects to a DGS (the purple thing labelled 'Server Node'), DGS's ONLY connect to the Replication Layer.

When they talk about Server Meshing they are really talking about two separate components - one is player/entity authority handover and the other is controlling which parts of the game universe are loaded onto a DGS in a shard... both of these will eventually be run from the RLGS but they are starting with the player handover as they described in that ISC.

The RLGS also simultaneously informs the Persistence Layer of change states caused by both players and backend services.

Spinning up DGS's are controlled by the RLGS and told which parts of the game they are to spin up - information from the Persistence Layer comes through the RLGS to inform spinning up DGS's what state they should be in. Thus you have synchronised continuity not just of player actions but of all events in the game universe

The always running Replication Layer has authority over all entities in the game universe shard, including players, the DGS's are 'meshed' through the Replication Layer that controls them, there is no duplication of locations within a shard. Is it all very complex? Yes they said it was complex in the ISC discussing it.

The way you seem to think that server meshing involves all DGS's talking to each other would be a massive waste of bandwidth because each DGS on a shard would be duplicating unnecessary information to all other DGS's.

You heard them say they are separating out the Replication Layer from the DGS's.. what more is there to say?

2. The system in it's final state will not have loading screens, that is temporary.

3. No extra load, players are logged into that system wherever they are.

4. This shows you do not understand the final plan or understand fully what the Replication Layer Gateway Service is. The star systems are all loaded in the simulation running through the RLGS, which communicates with the persistence layer to synchronise all events in the game no matter where they are in a shard... even when DGS's are shut down.

I forgot to explain why it is not server meshing they plan to implement with Pyro.

When you log in to the game and go to the menu you are in a lobby which has verified your account and assets. The Jump Gate tunnel won't run on a DGS it will only run on your local game client. While you are in the tunnel you log out of your starting star system DGS back to the player authentication service and when you reach a certain part of the tunnel you'll be logged back into your destination star system DGS - the tunnel is a client side loading screen.

...and I say you are in the wrong place if you have that mindset.

You have come to the Rolls Royce showroom and demanded a Rolls Royce made to the same specifications, in the same time frame with a delivery date acceptable to you and for the same budget as a Toyota Micra.

I would say... if you want a Toyota Micra, go to the Toyota showroom.

You only think you represent the majority - you don't. You want the benefits of a crowdfunded 'no middle men' game, but you don't want the inconvenience that such a game project naturally incurs.


The lore of the game and the Stanton system in particular is that Port Olisar is a major cargo/trading hub with a significant security presence in the system. Clearly the current PO doesn't fulfill either of those roles.

When asked what they would do with the current Port Olisar the only answer they gave was that it would get a fitting end and would remain in some form - I'm guessing probably as a derelict like Gundo(?) above Daymar.

Some of these claims are based on a misrepresentation - you only have to go to a planetary landing zone once per wipe, after you leave it is the players choice to go back. Don't like trams, trains or the like? Don't go back there.

Once the game is finalised to the point there are no more wipes and we have full persistence a person may only visit a planetary landing zone once in their game lifetime.

What is 'scope' in game development terms? Limitation, the sort of limits imposed by the money men.

If you prefer those limits to be in place all well and good, this, frankly isn't the game project for you. You can't pick and choose the bits you do and don't like, it comes as a package.

I haven't missed the point, you are arguing from the point of a fixed proposition, that of 'standard game design'... I'm telling you clearly this community didn't want 'standard' so any pre-conceived ideas based upon that standard are irrelevant.

It's a block by block game, some blocks are in some are not. many of the limiting features we have in the alpha are because of the limitations of the CryEngine game engine. The argument about '10 years' is not relevant when you are dealing with an unknown.

When the project was first pitched there was a very definite idea of what it would be, including the limitations of the then CryEngine 3 it was based upon. Chris knew certain elements of that game engine - namely 64bit precision - could be modified to achieve his stated goals, however when the community was demanding the BDSSE, and more importantly providing the will and funding to expand beyond that early vision there was a choice, stick to the planned timeline and budget (what would he do with the extra?) or use the the money he never expected and the will of the community to go beyond that original vision. He did ask what we wanted and the community overwhelming said to 'go go go!'.

Any adult realist knows that when you ask for the moon you need a big budget and a long time to achieve that goal. This is not 'standard development' because the majority in the community didn't want standard development - it is an experiment in iterative live game design.

We have been able to play in this alpha sandbox since December 23rd 2015 and it has been expanded upon regularly without cease since then, and unlike other games where you have to pay for expansion after expansion we as a community said we would provide the means for the 'never ending expansion' with CIG's assistance.

There are those who make snide comments that our grandchildren will play this game - as though there is nothing to play today - BUT THAT IS EXACTLY THE POINT! We didn't want a limited game to play for a few months and move on to the next bubblegum release, we wanted something that would last and expand. That change in approach has certain requirements that other game projects don't have, patience being the main one. If someone has joined the project not understanding that, and consequently suffering buyers remorse, it is up to them to use the system as provided to exit, which they could easily do - at a substantial profit I might add, which CIG are perfectly fine with since they provided the means to do it.

I watched Chris Roberts presentation at GamesCon in 2012, I watched for another year before deciding to support the project in a way I'd never support any other game project precisely because of that powerful community/developer partnership where gamers don't have to accept the limitations and deadlines imposed by the 'the suits' whose only interest is in making a profit from gamers. This project will remain 'in development' as long as there is a community with a will to enable it, and frankly it has been the most successful model of a game development partnership there has ever been.

Is it 'finished'? Certainly not, hell no! That is not a bad thing, it is THE difference that the majority who understood what the project was all about were looking for... and we have it in spades - No limits!

What is the point of Star Citizen? It is to prove that when you remove the money men with their self interest and instead work in partnership between gamers and a game developer amazing things become possible, things no-one else would even attempt. There is no way to quantify how long the impossible will take, which is why both the community and CIG know that, again unlike other games made in secret, we get to enjoy not only the game but our part in the design of that game and watch it grow. We get to say like no other game project - I was there man! I was a part of what made all this possible!

It's called 'a pipeline' because at various stages many developers work on a feature according to their schedule agreed and prioritised by managers with an overall view of the project and how those features fit together. Just because 2 appear to be working on it now that doesn't mean that's all the team members who will feed into that feature. Some team members are specialists, some are generalists.

The inventory system as it is now is a placeholder, it is planned that everything will be physicalised. No 'magic bags of holding' as Chris calls it.

The same is true of the white beacon suit and explorer helmet, it is a placeholder. It's temporary and they will likely not have a free suit/helmet on respawn.

Having watched the video I see that you have misunderstood what they said.

You will be trespassing immediately on entering private property, there is no timer, they mentioned "if you step off the ship a few seconds later" only to say that if you leave the private property that trespasser status will be removed.

While you are trespassing a player who owns the property or their invited party members can legally shoot you at any time.

Extremely unlikely, current generation of consoles wouldn't have the grunt to support it and the control set is too complex.

I have posited the notion that they may have module releases for Arena Commander on console. The company they gave ToW to develop mostly did work for Sony Entertainment Division.

It seems like make work for the sake of it. I'd rather have a variety of ships to choose from. You know what people are going to do with this thing, you saw them even on the video make a monstrosity of a top heavy cargo lifter, it just doesn't look realistic.

What they refer to as 'cutscenes' are not cutscenes in the traditional sense, they are game loaded action sequences with dialogue you still have control of your character during them. You can break away from them.

Key story information comes from video sequences which are displayed on screens in the game... diagetic as Jared likes to call it.

No it isn't one long movie.

The issue 
â
 with the progress tracker is that bug fixing and playtesting features also appears as assigned work on those features or chapters.

I believe this intended obscuration on the part of CIG. It's done when it's done is the best we'll get but in fairness no-one can quantify bug fixing, it takes as long as it takes. I bet the managers do quite a lot of head scratching about what to put in reports and the progress tracker so as not to give the game away.

The truth some are happy with the limitations and never really grasped that this project was all about removing those limitations. In another of my posts on the many threads about this topic I listed around 10 things Starfield won't have. It wasn't an exhaustive list.

The reason Starfield doesn't have atmospheric flight, you'll notice all external shots for landing and taking off is because the Creation Engine uses cell technology just like Skyrim. Yes they have introduced new procedural generation of assets to fill those cells, but it's still cell technology. I know because I've used the Skyrim Creation Kit.

What are you basing that on exactly?

The friends and org lists they have already said they will place on the same shard unless the player requests otherwise? Benoit Bausejor already outlined this at his Citizen on presentation on the plan for meshed server shards

How exactly do you think they can arrange player held events and race days already?

ROFL..

Like hair that flows and moves when you move or in the wind?
Like a unified 1st and 3rd person character rig?
Like physicalised cargo boxes with contents inside?
Like the ability to manually fit and remove ship modules?
Like ships and other physical structures that can bend and distort?
Like fire propagation?
Like.. no loading screens?
Like fully simulated water body physics?
Like healing gameplay that goes from hospitals through to med-guns?
Like multicrew?
Like mining with different ships, swappable components and modules as well as handheld and wheeled vehicles, with refining aboard ships and stations?


The list could go on, and on, but I'm sure these are enough to ponder.

Haven't you heard? The Star Map is being reworked.

Noticed a few things:
No EVA
No piloting to space.
No view of pilot landing via controls.
No physicalised cargo.
No ship in ship.
No ship to ship refueling.
No permanent damage to anything but destroyed ships.
Not a single strand of hair moved.
No healing / medical gameplay.

The PU is an alpha build WIP, it can't take the content of either Squadron 42 or Arena Commander right now. They can't just dump in content to a partially built WIP. There is a plan, it's a good one, pretty groundbreaking and they are working through that plan right now. Each part of the plan has it's part in the overall plan, Arena Commander is just one part of the plan, it's feature that will be in Squadron 42.

Loading screen to go from atmosphere to space is unlikely to be modded out very soon. There will be a loading screen for interplanetary POI to POI travel.

When assessing the depth of gameplay it's worth remembering that Todd Howard said they considered having refueling as a mechanic but decided against it, your ships will have infinite fuel. No Starfarers then.

It's almost certain it will have mining and crafting... but it'll be basic.

I am looking forward to seeing it and playing it, but there is not much comparison between Star Citizen and Starfield.

This.. quite frankly.. annoys me. What exactly do you think needs some special attention to come to the PU? Planets, with biomes atmospheres and physics that control the behaviour of things in them? No. They're using the exact same tools. Flora and fauna? No. They're using exactly the same tools. Game controls? No. They are using exactly the same tools. Animations? No. It's exactly the same tools.

The only special requirements the PU has is to connect to backend services that allow persistence and multiplayer... that's it... nothing else that you can touch, see, hear, or use is any different.. But you go on on making broad sweeping bland statements if it suits you.

All the backend services like NPC Scheduler, Mission Manager, Quantum and Quasar the Replication Layer and Persistence Layer are designed to plug into any level designed location. If your head is stuck in the idea that NPC's have to have scripts written to know where doors, walls and usables are you're out of date and not keeping up.

This is the problem, those who haven't the first clue, because long explanatory posts (either from the community or CIG) don't interest them and they have zero interest in researching the issues in game development as a whole yet they think they can tell CIG and us where the problems lie.

Name one.. just one thing in Squadron 42 that you think needs some major rework or change to bring it to the PU they have planned... just one.

Believe me I didn't expect everyone to read it and it's clear from replies that many haven't. My aim was to present the opposing side of the argument (CIG's side mainly) and the projects history so that those who wish to can put it all into context.

Chris has said on camera he has sympathy with those who say they backed the 2016 version of the game, but collectively this community and CIG gave themselves the opportunity to do far better, it's likely the majority would prefer that than a game with a short shelf life. The 2016 version would have been very similar to what is planned for Starfield - not bad, but not what the community was asking for when they all mostly asked for the Best Damn Space Simulator Ever. If we had learned he had the means and opportunity to do better and didn't take it the backlash would have been loud and noisy.

Those who have that mindset aren't in here demanding en mass that CIG take out features that only became possible because of that change in approach are they?

Mixing the 'it's taking too long' argument and expressions of frustration of 'Squadron 42 a waste of resources' is a non-sequitur. No-one knows how long a project like this should take, not even CIG, because it has never been done before. Do we all wish it to come sooner? Of course, even me, but we have to be realistic. This is not a known quantity (established developer using established tools) making a standard game and there are much less ambitious games that have taken as long with more spent on their development. Comparing to other games is pointless, there is nothing out there like it and no-one else is developing the tools to make anything like it possible, and as far as I'm aware there isn't even anything like it planned by any other developer in the future.

I'll give you an example, Outera - the group that made this 'whole planet simulation' did make the planet but this is merely mildly interesting to volume game developers because it was all hand made far too expensive in dev time and resources, they didn't develop tools junior developers could use to make spherical grid planets in volume. The thing that has taken the time for this project was making those unique tools that can be used time and time again to produce content at a faster and faster rate by people with much less development R&D experience. If you watch the ISC from 4 weeks ago about the Montreal Sandbox Team making derelict outposts you'll hear him say, they could take some team members off the team for other work because the tools had progressed so they could produce more, with less, faster. That is the aim of the project, a new way to make games, not just build games to a standard (limited) formula.

Everything that benefits the project as a whole goes on to extend the franchise, they don't have to remake everything for Episode 2 and 3. In effect they are building the base universe for as many stories as they want to tell in the future. How long has the Star Wars and Star Trek universes been built upon?

Once again... the capability of the current Alpha is not in a place to take all the Squadron 42 content, systems engineers and network engineers don't make planets, trees, rivers, AI. If you'd rather wait until they finish their part before even starting game universe content, then imagine how much longer the PU would take.

No he didn't you've got the cart before the horse again. The PU is a dependency of the Squadron 42 universe, it's where you go to retire after your military service, the same game universe you were a navy pilot in with added multiplayer capability and backend services.

I did say that the plan changed and why.

The millions of backers have added content to the game universe via their requests but the fundamental structure has not changed, all the backend services are being designed to plug as standalone additions to that game universe. There won't be any huge refactor of the Squadron 42 universe required as some seem to think, there will be some 'bring the universe up to date' art assets - the history wall at the Hurston Corporation for example which currently has no history of the Vanduul War on it. The game universe you retire to after your military campaign service is virtually identical to the game universe you will play Star Citizen in.

There are 3 timelines running:
The pre-Vanduul War timeline which is the current Alpha.
The Vanduul War timeline for your military service
The post military service timeline.

You can make as many assertions as you like but if you have no logic to back it up it's merely opinion based upon an erroneous assumption.

To state it clearly again.. the current Alpha PU is not capable of holding all the Squadron 42 content and it won't be until all those backend services are put into place - none of that is affected by how many players there are or what their demands are. The Alpha is a test-bed for multiplayer capability, it doesn't dictate the content of the game universe beyond that. There is only ONE game universe.

Seems you are fast on your way to equaling or surpassing your PP record.

There's a piece or two of logic you've missed.

Being a pilot, especially a combat pilot, at the skill level it will require will not be for all, certainly with the expense and meta of fancy-dancey flight controls. You're ruling out a whole class of gamers who would have no interest in piloting a ship, but might have an interest in ways to make their way through this game experience - specifically role players.

There is also the notion that ships will be as plentiful and easy to get and run as they are now, this won't be the case. Chris has said, ships will be for the 1%, the majority won't have them. If you don't have one, or want one, or the expense of running one, to fly yourself then a means of gainful employment is an option, turret gunner is just one of those options... it's a free seat to get where you might want to go. You assume the options in the RSI store will be the same as they are now with ships attached to game packages, it has to be that way now because 'gainful employment' options are in poor supply currently, it's likely it won't stay that way. Many have asked for non-ship related activities to make UEC.

Mirai Fury fighter jocks would have chosen a combat ship anyway, they aren't the ones options like turret gunner would appeal to.

You're thinking far too narrowly about what the future play possibilities are of this game project. That's what the Picard Palms are all about. This game is meant to appeal to groups and individuals on a large scale, where people have varying skills and preferences, different goals to achieve. If you're itching to do zero to hero, paid turret gunner is an option, just one of many to come.

But you do want to play in the same game universe.

The current PU can't hold that game universe, so stopping work on Squadron 42 won't help and it's is an error to think that those making content for Squadron 42 aren't also making content for Star Citizen, they are making it for both.

Backend system designers and network engineers don't make ships, planets, AI, landing zone areas etc so you'd still have to wait for those systems engineers and network engineers to do their work.. then wait for stuff to be made to go into it. Stopping Squadron 42 development will not speed up Star Citizen development in any way, it's more likely it would simply lengthen the time for the expansion of that game universe.

Squadron 42 is not simply background lore for the massively open universe MMO, the story of the Vanduul War is the reason that the whole game universe exists. Squadron 42 will be your first experience of that 'Living Breathing Universe' always planned.

1. I'm a guy that likes analogies (if you want to skip this part just go to section 2: The history of the project) so I'm going to use a well known phrase / idiom to describe what the issue is here.

There is a phrase 'Putting the cart before the horse' to suggest that someone has got their logic ass-backwards. The modern take is a literal one, the horse in front of a cart and how ridiculous that looks, but that isn't how the phrase originated. In the days of horse and cart someone could go buy a cart and thus spend money, however if they hadn't bought the horse first - and all the infrastructure to support it - land to graze on, stables, staff to work in the stables, a steady supply of feed and a farrier service then you had 'Put the cart before the horse' in the estimation of your priorities. You wanted the trappings but you didn't want to invest in the means to make those trappings useful, this is of course erroneous thinking, yes you can buy the fancy cart and have it outfitted with leather trim and velvet seats with brass lamps for headlights, but what point if you have no horse to pull it? The cart exists because of the horse, not the other way around.

2. The history of the project.
Chris had an idea for an updated Freelancer / Wing Commander type game that would be set in one game universe and the 'War story' would be a campign of missions you could drop into and drop out of to go roaming around this massive open world. Because each landing zone area would be gated behind a cutscene to each landing zone or area this was possible. They also hoped and indeed told everyone that was the plan that the campaign missions would have limited multiplayer. However... It was always the case that the idea should be that each players experience would be unique to them (their character history log) and that history would continue with you into the larger 'drop out' game universe.

When the rubber hit the road after the funds arrived to flesh out this idea more it became clear that the two notions of 'unique history for player' and multiplayer experience weren't compatible - how can it be a unique challenge to you if your performance and choices were affected by other players actions?

The best way to view what the plan originally was is to think of a the real world example of a military reservist (National Guard for our friends across the pond). You drop in when called back to duty and drop out to go back home when the duty is done. It all takes place in the same 'real world'.

When the notion of a seamless, no loading screen universe became a possibility this already somewhat irksome problem of how to have a unique to each player experience presented a solution and the funds to pursue that solution became available. The plan finally changed circa 2015 but there had been some head scratching prior to that. It was decided that now the multiplayer experience promised would be in the Star Citizen universe and you play the Squadron 42 campaign alone. To solve the complaint that some wanted the pre-2016 multiplayer experience they mooted the idea of of in game 'battle camera' simulation which could be the place where you can coop the fighting sections of the Vanduul War campaign. Thus Arena Commander.

If you have read the lore regarding Arena Commander you know that Original Systems were set up to make military training simulators and that later evolved into virtual game worlds for entertainment. As you can see Arena Commander is not some afterthought dreamed up to entertain the players/backers in a limited version of the game, you are playing the thing that you'll be using in Squadron 42 to train and review / improve your battle experience and mission scores. There is precedent for this, it worked exactly the same way in Wing Commander IV: Prophecy, originally planned and designed by, but not finally made by, Chris Roberts. This is where they have mooted the idea of coop play for Squadron 42, in the post battle analysis simulator where it has zero effect on your story campiagn history log choices.

3. The future
You will still be playing a drop in / drop out version of the game except that now you drop in for a whole campaign rather than just missions. There's some game design technicality to fix here because you could actually play both simultaneously and it's the same game character you play in both, excpet they are in a different timeline - the player history log updates on a per mission basis and this will update your 'retired' character's history in the PU as your history log fills out. The two games are connected because they are the same character and the same game universe.

As you can see, Squadron 42 was and is still being designed to exist in that same single game universe, it will be as fleshed out as the main game, it just doesn't need those systems that support an MMO experience and so it makes sense to develop it as a separate branch, but make no mistake, the game universe design as planned IS Squadron 42, not the the limited Alpha PU test-bed. People talk in terms of Squadron 42 'stuff' coming to the PU after launch, understandable because this is how they describe it themselves sometimes, but this isn't strictly accurate, it would be more accurate to say that the current PU will be merged into the Squadron 42 universe to extend it's functionality.

Why is it taking so long to put Squadron 42 stuff into the PU? Until now, and still, the PU before all the backend services like Server Meshing is simply not capable of holding all that Squadron 42 stuff and capability, it's as simple as that, the limited test-bed Alpha just can't cut it for that huge amount of content. If they concentrated on Star Citizen and dropped Squadron 42 you would STILL have to wait for the capability of the PU catch up to hold it all.

The PU is the cart that the Squadron 42 horse will make relevant.

So no, you didn't just pay for Star Citizen the multiplayer, you paid to enter and create unique characters in, and have, that whole game universe.

You understand.. Squadron 42 takes place in exactly the same Star Citizen universe? Indeed it is primarily what that universe was built for?

You understand that the current PU was a later addon (2016 onward) to be used as a test-bed we could play in for that Star Citizen universe?

No? Well I guess when you sign up for an Alpha it pays to do due diligence and look at the history of the project.

Your first experience with that whole intended 'Living Breathing Universe' will be Squadron 42. The massively multiplayer part was the 'extra' that came with the project, it wasn't the main thrust of the project which was to build a massive detailed game world that ran continuously in real time 'forever' which (to the player) appeared seamless and uninterrupted.

They said that now they have a tool to make rivers they can adapt that to make roads too. Rivers and roads means bridges... won't that be a relief.. somewhere to call home eh?

I almost never CTD and my equipment is much older. Last time was last year.

Instituting temporary fixes for service side 30K's is a bit of a waste of the engineers precious time given how infrequent they are for the majority and the fact that the current server architecture / function is also temporary.

As discussed in the last ISC regarding Server Meshing, once the Replication Layer Gateway Service has gone in you won't log into the DGS's anymore and so there won't be any 'service caused' 30K's (30K's are a client / server disconnect, they can also happen if someone has a problem with their internet).

They are also working on a DGS Crash Recovery Service (it's on the Progress Tracker), that will work from / through the Replication Layer and tie into the Persistence Layer. If you are disconnected from a crashed server all you will notice is that the game becomes unresponsive for a short period before you are transferred to a recovered server, you won't go back to menu.

So the informed mantra should be - When GIB Replication Layer?!! ...they are working on it now.

* DGS = Dedicated Game Server.

Server Meshing isn't the big problem because it's known technology - Chris stated that it wouldn't be as difficult as getting the full persistence and backend systems in place, making all the new systems work together with SM is the problem.

To make it clear:

Stage One - get servers running with the game on. Each is a standalone copy of the Stanton system and the servers are directly connected to backend services, like the NPC scheduler, but there's lots of backend services. Servers had no way to save state when they spun down. This was the state of affairs up to 3.17.X.

Stage two - Design and connect the Persistence Layer which has the hard copy record of the exact state of everything in the game universe rewritten several times a second so that DGS's spinning up can restore from EntityGraph (the hard copy game save)stored data - this they call generally the Persistence Layer. In order to do this and make the servers read from the Persistence Layer and write back to it they had to create a process on each DGS which they called 'The Hybrid Service'. This is what came with 3.18 and allowed in game persistence of non-player owned items. This is done, but there are teething troubles connecting the Hybrid Service to all the backend services.

Stage Three (Build 4.0) This is the hard part - Design and implement the Replication Layer Gateway Service (RL) which will run on it's own set of servers. This will replace the Hybrid Service which can be taken off the DGS's. Players will not connect directly to DGS's after the introduction of the RL - they will connect to the RL and all information, including player input controls, will go through the RL and be simultaneously sent to both the shards / DGS's and the Persistence Layer. The DGS will report their state several times a second back through the RL to the Persistence Layer. All network traffic from backend services will also go through the RL to be sent to the shards and Persistence Layer. This is what they are doing now, while they work on Server Meshing as well, but SM can't go in until the RL is in place and functioning.

In order to understand why the Replication Layer Gateway Service is necessary you must grasp the concept of 'authority'. Every entity in the game, including players, must be controlled by 'something' which has authority over them... this is why you are kicked back to the main menu when disconnected from a server which had authority over you. The thing that is going to have authority over every entity in the game in the final plan is the Replication Layer Gateway Service. Once that is in you will no longer log into a server or shard and you won't be kicked back to menu if a server or shard connection is lost. There are other services which work to maintain the constant 'always on' game universe such as the DGS Crash Recovery Service which is coming.

The more astute among you will recognise what this is - the tunnel is a loading screen running on your local PC while you are logged into the Replication Layer Gateway Service until you are logged back in to your destination server.

As discussed in the last ISC that covered Server Meshing, before they go for full Static SM implementation they are going to put the RL in place and run Stanton and Pyro each on their own server on a shard - while in the Jump Gate tunnel the Replication Layer Gateway Service will take authority over the entities passing through the tunnel then transfer that authority back to whichever server you land on. If it works as planned you won't notice it happening, to you, you just flew the tunnel from Stanton to Pyro but you actually jumped servers.

Eventually the RL will take many more services from the DGS shards, and it will communicate between the Persistence Layer, all Shards and any backend services.

Once the Replication Layer Gateway Service has gone in, is fully functioning and tested, they can then go for stage four.

Stage Four - Implement Static Server Meshing and tie all functions of the RL through the Shard Manager Service to each DGS on a shard. Remove the temporary client side loading screen.

So you can see, the thing taking the time isn't the known technology of Server Meshing some of which functions are in the RL, it's the brand new never done before backend services mainly the Replication Layer Gateway Service that are needed to support meshed server shards.

But of course it's easier to just call it all - Server Meshing for simplicity.

They have discussed this in the early days. As pointed out above it is an objective based campaign set within an open world which is run 'in real time' (you'll notice that every time they show Squadron 42 excerpts there is always a time and location given), since you are under military orders there would be certain restrictions and there is a brig you could be sent to for insubordination - however there is off duty time, during that off duty time you'll have some freedom to do what you want to do. Your first experience of that 'Living Breathing Universe' they have always talked about will be in Squadron 42.

You will be making choices, and those choices will have effects later down the line during the whole life of your character. Everything you do is timestamped on your personal history log which is unique to you.

The 'lieutenant' problem (ie you are always referred to by your rank not your name) mentioned in the vertical slice is because you aren't playing a named character, you are playing your created character fulfilling a role. As Jared has said "Squadron 42 is basically one huge dynamic mission inside the Star Citizen universe." As we know there is no 'undo' or going back in time in Star Citizen. In the vertical slice mission, rather oddly it may seem, Old Man Colton - the senior officer on the sortie, says 'your choice' when choosing how to go about an objective.

Chris has said that they had to give careful thought to where and how they implement resets (or game save points), this is because you aren't going to be allowed to go back and check out each different available choice with the same character - they have discussed selling character slots without the full game package. So basically if you want to explore other options than those your character chooses in Squadron 42 you'll have to restart from the beginning with a new character, which you can then choose to continue for the life of that character. That's why you are permitted to purchase multiple copies of Squadron 42 in the store.

Following on from what some are mentioning as optional mission objectives I know from a conversation with Erin Roberts in 2015 and a later Q&A with Chris Roberts on SC Live that anything you do in Squadron 42 will / may have consequences not in only Squadron 42 but also in Star Citizen. Your collective possessions, training and character history go with you when you retire your Squadron 42 character to the PU. It is a continuation of the life of your Squadron 42 created character.

So... yes.. all indications are that Squadron 42 will not be an 'on rails' game - Chris has actually stated it won't be an 'on rails' game. In this respect it is somewhat like the Hitman approach - you have objectives, but how you go about those objectives is up to you.

Yes, we'll be able to hang clothing / flight suits in lockers and cupboards. No worries, it's coming.

Ship hangars are also coming to the main game when we have player owned residences... so they'll probably have some clothes hangers too.

Quite so.. Grimhex racing, or anything in the main game like it, is a different case potentially, we'll have to see.

The show was about Arena Commander modules, you can't purchase REC the way you purchase UEC. Are people under the impression you'll be gambling with UEC in Arena Commander? Why?

You can't convert REC to UEC for use in the main game.

You can't convert UEC or anything bought with UEC / Cash into REC.

Yes subscribers get REC as a bonus for subscribing, but you can't use it anywhere except in Arena Commander for items that don't persist outside of each Arena Commander match. There is no persisting benefit to anything bought with REC, which is why it's called rental equipment credits.

Arena Commander is the game simulation within the game simulation that is Star Citizen / Squadron 42.

If people want to interpret Australian / European game gambling law that way then technically any game that gives you some free-play benefit if you win / participate would also be gambling. Mass Effect has slot machine gambling for virtual credits, it isn't banned in any country under that pretext as far as I know. There are other reasons why games are banned... and Star Citizen does feature violence, criminality and drug use. It's likely it, or Squadron 42, will also feature some level of what some might consider 'adult' content with regard to human relationships.

Jared did say at the end of the second video there are AC modes still in development they aren't ready to share yet. The question for some is, has the question(s) been answered but perhaps it just isn't the answer you want? It isn't as if they are sitting on their hands doing nothing, content to keep players occupied is going in - at an increasing rate. If that is what they have in the shop window, it's not hard to see that the backroom work is likely to be even more busy.

Whatever special access or privilege people think they have, and yes it is different to the norm, this is still game development.

Ah but if only they could! Unfortunately the DNA and FOIP requires far more facial bones than usual, well FOIP did once they whipped it into shape to fit all those new bones.. dang it!

Good thing though.. DNA does allow facial asymmetry which is hella-rare! That finicky old 'attachment problem' butt had to be kicked first to get that working - thanks Evo! Drag the jaw you also have to resize the gum and teeth part otherwise it's somewhat unsightly, dem facial anim's can go a bit wonky.

Someone correct me if I'm wrong but didn't they say they were up to 24 layers for the overlays? Yikes! 24!

That is insured for it's monetary value, the owner knows they'd never get an exact replacement of the Mona Lisa on loss which is what the OP is suggesting.

If it is a replaceable item, by whatever means a copy is made, and not a unique one-off (as I said), then sure.. replace it. If EVERYTHING was copy-able it ipso facto means there will be NO truly unique items, I don't think that would be good and we know they plan to have unique one-off items in the game because they said so. There are lots of faked Hadesian artifacts out there sold by scammers - read the lore, but only the original ones from Hades will unlock the secret of Hades which can only ever happen once. It's a puzzle piece chase, only the original set will solve the puzzle, pointless if they can be exactly copied.

I have an Hadesian artifact as part of my game package, I will not know if it is an original unless I undertake the mission(s) to go find out... and it might be one of the fakes. It's a lottery.

This isn't Elite Dangerous. There is no full persistence, death of a spaceman in Elite Dangerous.

There's what we have been shown of the Odin system and we know they have worked on Nyx because after Delamar's removal from Stanton they put in a medical clinic and told us.. so that's 4.

1. If you go to the Star Map and check the routes you'll see that there are other systems you have to go through to get from Stanton / Pyro to Odin, in total around 12+ have some connection to either PU systems or Squadron 42 systems.

2. The very first landing zone ever shown off was Prime on Terra III, again look at the Star Map. I was told face to face that the Terra Nova system was originally planned as the first system for the PU but it was changed. This was at a time when 'Squadron 42 had to be the priority'. Why was the Terra system being chosen? No point in adding extra work, might as well use a system you know is for Squadron 42 anyway.

3. If you look at the subscriber vault images for concepts of star systems, check the names and locations on the Star Map they do indeed mostly follow the pattern I mentioned at 1. Also, most lore initially and currently being fleshed out is linked to those star systems.

4. Look at the progress tracker and read the monthly reports, there are features in active development that have no / little use case in the star systems we know about.

5. They keep featuring in-game locations, with features and capabilities not currently in the game, in extended 'promo' videos when there isn't any need to go to that level of work simply to sell a ship. Those who think it is just advertising don't seem to have any idea of the level of work that would be involved to make those environments. Akem's Razer - is it more likely they'll use existing assets for promo's or are they more likely to allocate resources to make unnecessarily elaborate whole new throwaway 3D environments, with narrative, just to show off a ship that appears for a few seconds at the end of a video?

6. They put Arena Commander racing at Aydo on Green in the Ellis system - there's a ton of lore about it, Murray Cup Racing was a big subject in the early days of the project when everything was about Squadron 42 and it being a 'drop in / drop out campaign', it was the reason for the racing class of ships AND the Galactic Gear series - and what do you know, after Sean Tracy said it was easier to put a whole planet into Arena Commander for a single FPS mission (The Good Doctor - set in the Leir system featured in the Sandworm playthrough demo), we just now are expecting Green in the Ellis system to come to AC in 3.19 and it's timed to occur along with a change of price for Squadron 42.

There's one thing we know about CIG, because they keep telling us, it's that they don't start work on something (or continue it after a change of priorities) before they think they need to - the take from that is that all current work across all departments relates to either the storyline for Squadron 42 - the first Vanduul attack is in Vega so basically that's set in stone, it has to be there - or intervening star systems to connect them to the PU. Jared Huckaby said on camera "Squadron 42 is basically one giant dynamic mission set in the the PU". Again check the Star Map, look at routes from Vega to any star systems known to be WIP - in Squadron 42 there are no time jumps that teleport you from one unconnected system to another, you will be going through all connected systems to get where you are going.

We were also told the vertical slice demo mission was a side mission in the campaign, according to Chris in the directors commentary, it's about 1/3rd the way through the full campaign. My take on it is that is part of an expanded origin / backstory of our character that was added after the main campaign was decided upon. My reasoning for this was that the Odin system was a very early funding stretch goal to add 10 more star systems to the verse - around 2 years after the main Squadron 42 campaign was planned. Chris has said on camera that the Squadron 42 campaign story was expanded. As far as CIG are concerned the Odin system was already known to us precisely because it was one of the stretch goal systems mentioned, so it's perfect for a non-spoiler reveal - give them one they already know about that isn't part of the main Vanduul War campaign.

Anyone who suggests that Squadron 42 will only feature Vega and the Odin system are so deep into a narrow focused skepticism that they have lost any sense of reasonable proportion they are simultaneously sticking their fingers in their ears singing la la la while burying their head in the sand and pissing into the wind, there are over 30 chapters and each has several branching missions. Very large amounts of the game lore relating to Squadron 42 are attached to the UEE based on Earth - one of the early stretch goals was to add a 4th landing zone to Earth you don't need landing zones on Earth if the Admiral Bishop speech to the Senate is just some video to show what's happening in the story, the UEE naval military based in Kilian (we know we start as a rookie pilot in training, the only place to do that training is in Kilian, it's what Fleet Week recruiting is all about) and the Terra system.

There is one question guaranteed to make a dev on camera go quiet.. then timidly ask.. do you mean of the ones we're allowed to talk about? It's notable that Jared even asks them the question 'Where's your favourite place in the game?'. I know they are just itching to tell us, Jared's always trying to get us clues. I've met them in person and it's the same. We know all about Stanton, Pyro, Odin and Nyx from videos, monthly reports and the progress tracker - so where are these places they don't want to talk about, can't even mention the name of? If they are even considering it as a 'favourite location' they must have been there to see it, and it must be in a state that impresses even them.

When they built / outfitted their new offices in LA and Manchester they used concept art for a wall mural of Prime on Terra III (the 3D model we've all seen was of Prime) at the LA office and they used an etched glass door with a line plan outline of the Super Dreadnought for their meeting room at Foundry 42 UK in Wilmslow, the main office where most of the Squadron 42 work was being done. There are 3 lines of known Squadron 42 lore and in engine footage that say Kilian absolutely will be in Squadron 42. Some of the very first in engine footage was of the naval shipyard in Kilian where that Super Dreadnought is being built, it is an integral part of the Squadron 42 story, it is Admiral Bishop's pet project. When that footage capture of the shipyard was shown, everyone was very pleased to see it, but no-one was surprised by it because at that time the PU wasn't even thought of and EVERYTHING was related to Squadron 42, absolutely everything.

We know Squadron 42 will have fully realised planetary systems that you can roam about in because that was always the plan - to be able to drop in and drop out of the campaign, that was 'the verse' they always referred to textured balls in space with landing zones you reached by cutscene - that notion didn't change until the PU became a fully realised thing in 2017 that took away the need for enclosed landing zones. Jump Gates between systems was part of that earliest plan.

The PU didn't even exist as an idea prior to Brian Chambers opening the Frankfurt office and researching procedural planet creation tech AND the subsequent work by Evo Herzeg to be able to apply physics to those spherical grid planetary bodies so that we could touch them, we had the social module Area 18, the hangar module which was connected to the social module and AC to play in, it was planned to stay that way until Squadron 42 released, it was never mentioned prior to late 2015 after the Squadron 42 mocap shoot was completed (that mocap shoot necessarily includes every location in the Squadron 42 campaign where there is a landing zone or playable asset located) and after we had seen the 'Morrow Tour' of the Stanton video which was the expanded Squadron 42 story line. Nothing of the original Squadron 42 campaign was changed, that means all the story, characters and locations haven't changed.

The Live PU and all the technology to support it was the addon to the project after 2015 because the community was getting thoroughly bored of Arena Commander and the extremely limited social module yet still the community was raising far more money than Chris ever expected to get. If we discount 64bit precision and other work for Squadron 42, the PU as now planned was only started in late 2016.

It wasn't procedural planet tech that opened the gate to the Stanton system it was the completion of 64bit precision that allowed a massive play space and all they had to put in it was an asteroid base, Delamar / Levski, a very small planetoid, and some space stations until procedural planet tech gave us moons and planets to land on well over a year later in late 2017. They didn't even put in the ArcCorp Area 18 landing zone which we were all running around through the hangar/social module. Everything that went into that first version of Stanton was originally made for Squadron 42, they were the only assets ready for player use that fit and didn't involve massive spoilers or discarded systems like the auto-pilot ATC cutscenes. The first version of the Stanton system was a hastily cooked up rushed job to give the backers somewhere to go that felt like real space. I know Levski was originally made as an FPS level landing zone (hence being put in a crater you weren't supposed to be able to get out of) because in March 2016 I visited F42 UK and the guy who made Levski told me so. He didn't say it in a whisper as if confiding some deep dark secret, he said it matter-of-factly as if it was bloody obvious - which of course - it is. We all knew Delamar was supposed to be in the Nyx system.

The problem is a Windows system one, not a CIG developer one. Have you ever used an image editor that gives you a warning that says.. 'You've left a large amount of data in system memory would you like to save that data?'

Very large files are not held by Windows in RAM if they are not frequently/currently being accessed, they are shifted to the pagefile for fast retrieval for the less frequently accessed files. There is constant error checking of RAM by Windows, there is no error checking of the pagefile. Windows will do this no matter how much RAM you have installed because the Windows Operating System is a 'one size fits all' beast, unless you create a RAM-disk with all that extra installed RAM and allocate the pagefile to that, which is of course a definitely risky thing to do. Let's not even get into the fact that many are not fully conversant with how Windows operates and don't bother to shut down programs running in the background which could randomly fill RAM while the game is running - Google Chrome for example. Windows 10 or 11 system can randomly fire up process that will use 8 - 12GB of RAM, that's part of the reason for Windows game mode.

The advantage is that anything controlled by occlusion culling, off screen culling and Object Container Streaming etc doesn't have to be permanently loaded into RAM to avoid a stutter-fest.

We in the community, not CIG, advise people to increase their pagefile and place it on their fastest drive to reduce stuttering / game pauses and long load times while assets load because if you rely on Windows to dynamically manage the pagefile size you could run out of disk space for the pagefile mid-game especially if you have lots of background processes running and you are using the OS drive as the game storage drive. Those with 'small' VRAM will also have the RAM and thus it's impact on the pagefile to offset deficiency in VRAM.

Star Citizen uses very large files which have to be decompressed into RAM from the .pak file on load, significantly larger than most games. That's why other spaceship games don't have detailed ship interiors or very detailed exteriors (without loading screens), even the smallest ships in Star Citizen have way more complex 3D models (read bigger file size in RAM) and detailed exteriors than other games.

So... you can have way larger game download size if they don't compress the game data, smaller file size less detailed models in the game with less detailed surfaces and fewer LOD's, a smaller play space volume with much smaller draw distances, with loading screens or on-screen 'popping in' of game assets...

...or in a game designed to run on the most popular operating system in the World on machines with varying capabilities you can do what Windows does natively and just use the pagefile to do exactly what it is designed to do very efficiently - in ideal circumstances - for the majority.

Or, you could assign an engineering team to research and design a game that changes the way Windows manages RAM, that complies with Microsofts game licensing rules, for the very few who can afford beasty expensive gaming rigs, a system those with less capable machines probably wouldn't be able to use.

Even the 'creative types' know these basic facts about how the Windows OS works.

Edit: Programs like Photoshop are not just image editors, they also compress images for smaller file size, if they didn't the raw image data would be huge for each file, it's generally the uncompressed raw image data that is loaded into RAM or VRAM (unless you've got one of those top of the line very modern GPU's that can handle compressed images). Star Citizen also uses image compression for it's 3D model overlays and that's why you have to have the shader cache. Your CPU/RAM puts the 3D model into the virtual space, your GPU/VRAM puts the image skin on that 3D model so that you can see it.

They addressed this issue. Size is not the problem (except that ships that size need a larger team and take more time), the main problem is that the BMM is unique (Jared's favourite word 'Bespoke'), it has no shared assets with any other ship so if they dedicated a team to a capship of that size then any ships that could share resources/parts would have less dev resources if the team was tied up with the BMM. They summed it up by saying, one BMM or 5 other ships produced with shared assets for the same amount of dev resources in the time.

It's worth noting that the BMM was concepted at a time when few ship manufacturers had more than 1 or 2 ships in their inventory and before ship system modules were a thing to take account of.

They explained about problems regarding this with the Retaliator modules (the original question being answered was 'what is happening to modular ship design'?), until not that long ago they couldn't get the control set from the cockpit to activate anything on attached modules because they are separate from the main hull entities (with the Hull C, D and E the engine drive section are separate entities).. but that's been fixed now.

The Retaliator also needed a rework (done apparently) because the torpedo arms were part of the main hull structure - they also resized doors and corridors to allow ship system module fitting, so even if they made modular bays to fit it would still have the torpedo holders sticking through the bays. Since the Retaliator is for Squadron 42 the 'fixed version' was/is being tested there. Having found solutions, they can now use those for the Hull C.

They have been known, but very rare, only 5 reports of a triple in the last 250 years. They were viewed as imaginary until a photo was taken of one in Germany in 2011... there was also a quadruple rainbow photo taken in Germany that same year.

All rainbows are double, it's just that very often you can't the see the outer fainter one.

June 6th 1944 Operation Overlord - more popularly known as the D-Day landings in Normandy. The 'D' is for 'Decision' since the operation had been in planning for many months, and even postponed several times.

hey have already said they will have aurora, and I'm sure they will have rainbows... they have the right conditions for it. The first video showing off the earliest Area 18 had rain. There are planets with oceans and ocean planets so the water cycle would be noticeable by it's absence not much chance Chris would be happy with that.

It's a lot less subtle and nuanced than that. There is a bit of 'player annoyance' in the intent especially aimed at newcomers, but the main aim is to make it so the streamers (the very people this project relies on to spread the word) do 'this game bad, CIG bad developer' publishing for them. Happens every milestone, in-game event and every celebration of something. This jiggery-pokery only happens on a small percentage of servers, because there just aren't that many of them that think it's worth the time... more clap from the sidelines, go to Reddit to downvote and be generally obnoxious.. or even come in here to bump pointless 'intended to fan the flames' threads and upvote their 'heroes'.

Oh yeah... snow-storming the forum with bait threads is another favourite tactic. While your link is informative - thank you, a link to the Frontier Developments Elite Dangerous long running Star Citizen thread would be even more eye-opening, and significantly more relevant.

It's planned to be a constantly running, never stops 24/7, 365 day/year universe simulator. This simulation of the whole universe run on the backend is mirrored to the Live game service via the Replication Layer Gateway Service for the places where players are so that DGS's on each shard are spun up with a copy of that location that the players exist in. Time never stops in this simulation, this is why you can't log in to find your avatar in the exact same state as you left it.

The systems are being designed to do as you asked, as explained by others above. EntityGraph is what underpins this persistence, it is a hard recorded snapshot of everything, including players (millions of entities) in the game universe several times a second to restore the universe state back to if there is a failure at any level. There is a 'DGS crash recovery suite' planned which will use EntityGraph to restore newly spun up servers that replace those that went down.

Hopefully you'll always stow your character via the log out methods - I believe we will get camp beds we can use if you're away from a viable log out place.

However if you are logged off without being stowed and the DGS / Replication Layer Gateway Service is still running then it is planned you will indeed be 'autopiloted' back to the nearest safe harbour to 'stow' your character, however there is no guarantee that process will be uneventful. That AI is still operating in the same game universe under the same conditions as everything and everyone else.

The most vehemently toxic in the community, surprising to some maybe, are the ones who use multiple accounts on Spectrum. They aren't particularly concerned about 'the rules'. There are many many huge supporters of the project who don't visit the forum anymore because of this toxicity. This was by intention, to drive away the most knowledgeable and helpful.

Ok. Let me break this down.

Currently each DGS is acting as a standalone shard. Let's say there are 10,000 players on 100 shards - each shard is sending duplicate data about the state of everything on that shard. Let's say there's one player awaiting the hangar doors at New Babbage Spaceport on every shard - that's 100 'open hangar door' network requests to register on pCache - 1 from each shard.

With static server meshing there may be 1 shard with as many servers meshed together as needed covering the Stanton system, only 1 of those servers is holding New Babbage Spaceport, but the other 9,999 players are spread around Stanton across all the meshed servers on that shard. With this set up there is no duplication of the New Babbage Spaceport 'open hangar door' network data sent to the pCache. We've gone from 100 standalone shards sending data about that entity - the hangar door - to 1. No duplication, even with Static Server Meshing.

For reasons of signal travel time over the world network backbone they will have regional shards for a long time to come and so the number of shards maybe around 10 - 15. On each shard there can only be one New Babbage Spaceport. Remember there is no limit to the number of chunks of the Stanton system that can be held on a meshed server system, they could have one planet per server, one moon per server even one space station per server. Because the amount of entities per game area has been significantly reduced it's player load per server can be raised, ie more players playing together on a shard - they are all on the meshed server shard in that area simultaneously and able to interact with each other. There is no duplication of entities within that shard.

Static Server Meshing is not as efficient because if even 1 player is present in an area a server for that area has to be spun up if the meshed servers already spun up don't include that area - the statically meshed server's area of authority once spun up is fixed = Static. 1 player on Cellin for example, while everyone else stayed around Crusader on the Crusader meshed server.

Dynamic Server Meshing means that if a player at busy Crusader decides to go all on his lonesome to Cellin, rather than having to spin up another server just for Cellin the boundary of authority of the server holding Crusader is extended to include Cellin, it's borders are not fixed, they are dynamically reacting to what the player is doing. It doesn't change the number of shards, but it maximises the server player population per shard.

So.. yes, Static Server Meshing will massively reduce the number of running shards, and that will cut down on duplicated network traffic per shard.

It's all related to the reworked network traffic between the Hybrid Layer (what will become the Replication Layer Gateway Service) and the pCache which is the hard copy database that persistent entity streaming uses to load up up-to-date servers... and yes they are getting out of sync, when the player sees the door to the hangar open, the pCache has it recorded as closed - so the next time the pCache gets a record of where the ship is.. boom! and the wreckage persists. The bandwidth required for this network traffic is huge, any stoppage (disconnect) or slowdown results in what we see in the game. They can and will still keep tweaking for better network performance but the thing that will make it all go away finally is Server Meshing because this will massively reduce the number of shards sending duplicate data to the Hybrid Service and pCache.

There are thousands of shards running copies of the Stanton system right now, the more players the more shards. Every single one of them is plugged into this persistent entity streaming suite of networked systems and sending updates of entity states on each server several times a second. Some of that data is just not making it through either at all, or in time.

You don't know what combo packages they are considering, they might offer a tempting discounted combo that comes within your already spent budget. They may even offer a discounted Squadron 42 standalone for existing backers. The fact that they've taken all combo's down as well as the addon suggests a full on rework of combos. They know very well what the community considers a 'must have' hot combo pack.

Let's not judge until we see.

The main game that only a few short weeks ago (May 12th) got a massive backend tech upgrade to support full persistence in a live multiplayer environment like no other, that game you mean? You understand the Arena Commander upgrades are by a different team from those networking and engineering teams working on the PU, and were planned months ago?

Yes, but it was it rudimentary and Chris wanted it improving. No point in having one system for the SataBall game and a completely different improved system for Squadron 42 and the PU as a whole.

I don't think copyright has any bearing, there's no copyright for racing wheeled vehicles around a track is there? Have you taken a look at some of the ships? It's different enough. They can only copyright the content for the book and movie, they can't copyright an idea for a game they never made. Did you see the sandworm at the CitizenCon demo? Chris Roberts long time friend and colleague, Ortwin Freyermuth (a lawyer specialising in the entertainment industry) used to own and run a movie production company before they started Cloud Imperium Games, if anyone knows more about copyright than them they're unlikely to be hanging around in this forum.

SataBall, often assumed to be dead because no-one talks about it. There are cryptic references to it in the PU, look around. It required tractor beam push pull, only recently in the game, and hand to hand zero G traversal.. shown off at last CitCon as being worked on for Squadron 42.

They also used to talk frequently about The Spectrum, particularly the news shows. Now silence.

You know what else mostly lies behind a wall of silence that never used to? Squadron 42.

Why did they talk about SataBall all those years ago? I can give you the answer to that straight from Jared Huckaby's lips to me in person just over a year ago... "The PU was originally going to start in the Terra system", not Stanton. It was the advent of procedural planet production that changed that. Where is the most prestigious SataBall Arena? In geostationary orbit of Terra III directly above the city of Prime.

I asked another question, If Squadron 42 was always the priority why didn''t they start work on Squadron 42 star systems first?... The answer... A long look, and silence from Jared. The 4 star systems we know they have done work on - Terra, Stanton, Pyro and Nyx all connect in a line to the Odin system. When the PU was first released the only planetary landing zone that was ready for players was Delamar - but Delamar is in the Nyx system, they've gone quiet about Nyx too. The first WIP landing zone they ever showed off, complete with an underground railway and shopping / business district was the city of Prime, it is the wall mural in the LA offices. In his early days there was a leak of CIG WIP, the one that grabbed everyone's attention was the 3D model of.. you guessed it, the city of Prime landing zone.

SataBall is not "dead".

I will give you credit for looking all that up, there's a couple of nuances you missed.

In his description of the state of the ToW gameplay Sean did say that overall performance was good but at certain points it tanked and they were looking into why.

ToW uses the same equipment yes, but we know that the new system for HUD overlays are being worked on in Squadron 42.

I have discussed previously that it is interesting that they chose Firesprite to partner for ToW, why? Because the bulk of their work was for Sony Entertainment Division, for consoles.

Chris has said that Star Citizen and Squadron 42 are unlikely to come out on consoles because they don't have the capability or flexibility to run those game modes.. but they might run a standalone console version of Arena Commander modules set in the Star Citizen universe.

It certainly would widen the reach to a broader playerbase and be a continuing revenue stream for the project as a whole if Arena Commander modules were supported on consoles. There are wrinkles, contracts and licenses etc. There would also be work needed to update HUD elements to fit that narrow use case... More 'gamified' than for PC.

I don't know any more than anyone else on the matter, but it's an interesting thing to ponder. Timing would be important if it were the case.

Well, well, well. Isn't this interesting. When Sean Tracy told us about the 'new' FPS map that came in 2019 he said it was easier to put in the whole planet then restrict the players from moving out of the playspace area.

Aydo on Green in the Ellis system, ready for players to run around some... OK. It'll be interesting to see how it compares the concept art in the Chairman's Club Handbook.

You do come out with a lot of odd statements.

Server tick rate is dependent on RAM load. The number of players doesn't have the effect many think it does. If all the players stay in a small area then Server Object Container Streaming doesn't have to load into server RAM many instances of other areas of Stanton (and all those areas contain) where the players aren't, so more RAM for players and their gear.

The worst case scenario for server RAM load is if all the players spread to all areas of the Stanton system. Now all players and all of Stanton and contents has to be streamed into Server RAM.

Areas not loaded into server RAM do not use up CPU cycles with AI, mission logic and movement physics etc.

Why not bring all the Arena Commander stuff to the PU? Because those not engaged in the event, or those having to travel from various spawn points will fill up the RAM due to SOCS... And of course there's no requirement for full persistence network traffic through the Replication Layer in Arena Commander.

Ah.. yes. This is an oft discussed topic, but sadly not a well identified topic.

The current Star Citizen Alpha is majority CryEngine legacy capability at it's core with a some CIG 'networked in' features.
The truth is the majority of CIG's work has been, and remains, on the backend - which is massive in scope and scale compared to anything else.

CIG don't point out what is legacy (if somewhat updated) CryEngine and future intended design, we have to do detective work to figure that out. For example we know that 64bit precision, signed distance fields and Object Container Streaming are not CryEngine features, but the current waterbody simulation and hit scan/hit registration are. The player avatar rig is all CIG, but the attachment points to that rig are still basically using CryEngine that has been bullied into adding functionality. The scripted mission system is a shoehorned in CryEngine mainly feature, whereas the game external controls - elevator touch pads, mobiglas etc are CIG design and they are, somewhat to many peoples surprise, handled via the backend network not locally on the game client.

The multiplayer environment isn't conducive to testing some features, especially first person experience features or AI control, and so they do that in the controlled environment that is Squadron 42 Episode One feature testing.

If you could be more specific about what you would like to see PES do we can talk about each use case, an interesting discussion could be had on that basis. 'Trash' as you put it is just tier 0 outcome, they've dug the foundation but left it for a while to see what we make of it, or how the system handles it. They've plugged it in, checked it's working, so on the bigger things.

The answer we have come to expect, and it is reasonable, is 'priorities and resources'. All things might be possible but it's generally 'big picture stuff first' unless there's a few new recruits with features they can cut their teeth on.

We may not like it but the current Alpha is a testbed only. When they say 'Playable Now', they mean on average you can log in and see the game universe with a few odds and ends to do mainly because of that CryEngine base capability (the way a developer thinks of 'playable'.

Hmm interesting. Well, in my view the intentions of the OP are well meant even if there is evidence of a lack of boning up on the subject. No matter, it's everybody's first show sometimes!

It might be a good idea to review how we got here:
The first form of persistence came from a standalone service that ran on the backend - player item persistence - we've had that for years now. At first it didn't persist the state of any player owned item, but then around 2018 when shipboard persistence came along that changed somewhat. This form of persistence from a backend stored cache required Object Container Streaming to be implemented both on the PC game client and on the DGS. Unlike CryEngine 3 which is the base of this current Alpha saves are not stored locally on the PC client.

The way it used to work was... this backend service knew what was 'game universe owned' according to the game services and what was 'player owned'. The first form of persistence for the player was, once you had an item on your person or in your ship you took ownership from 'the game universe' so that it became player attributed. This allowed ship renting and ship buying in the game. There was no persistence for 'game universe owned items', when a server spun down or crashed anything not on you or in your ship was lost. Any 'unstowed' ship or item was lost, 'stowed' refers to being recorded on a hard drive in a database not just in server RAM.

With the advent of PES the previous attribution services are being deprecated and replaced with a whole universe persistence of every item and it's state. They started that process of transferring from the old databases with 3.18 - hence why a lot of things went wonky because that (now massive) database of items required a lot of server bandwidth... but it get's more complex than that.

Prior to 3.18 they used to connect players directly to the DGS (Dedicated Game Server) and it communicated with all the backend services through specific runtimes that ran on each DGS - this means that when a server went down all information was lost about what happened on that server because that information was only held 'live' in server RAM. Now there is a layer in-between those backend services and logged in player, initially they called it the Hybrid Service but when it is all finally in place with server meshing it will be called the Replication Layer Gateway Service (Replication Layer for short). The job of the Replication Layer is to take input from a virtual simulation of the game universe that is 'always on' - ie Persistent. It will run 24/7, 365 days/year, while it is running it records a timed snapshot of the exact state of every item in the game universe to a 'hard database' initially called the iCache, now referred to as pCache (or Persistence Cache). The advantage of this (some of them at least) is that this persistent virtual universe can always be queried from that constantly updated hard copy when a DGS spins up, and it saves the state of any server spun down or crashed to the pCache (there is a crash recovery service that runs on the backend too in this plan). Now you can see that the old attribution services are no longer necessary, because the pCache records who owns what and where and what state it is in.

Let's pause a moment to think about what the Replication Layer has to do:

It takes input from many backend services - the players inputs, the NPC Scheduler Service, the player item attribution service, the Persistent Entity Streaming service, Quantum, Quasar to name but a few. Everything is timestamped, sorted and prioritised.

The servers are running at capacity, they have 128GB of RAM - each server (thousands of them) is sending a snapshot of what it has in it's RAM several times a second and passing that to the Replication Layer for sorting, prioritising and recording to the pCache.

No data is written to a servers hard drive once it has spun up. While it is being spun up the hard drive is loaded first with the base 'level designer made' copy of whichever part of the game universe it will have authority over (currently every server has all of the Stanton system), then the pCache is queried for any additions and change states to bring that server hard drives contents up to the current time and state of the game universe (you'll notice when you open the game console there is a display of the game universe time).

The Replication Layer also loads any assets that the current state of the game universe demands from any backend services and sends that to the server hard drive. Once this process is complete players are assigned to the server where-upon Server Object Container Streaming decides what areas and assets need to be loaded from the server hard drive into server RAM so that players can see and interact with them.

Currently, without server meshing, there is a huge amount of duplication of network transmitted data because each server has a unique copy of the Stanton system but once server meshing goes in then each shard will have servers that only have authority over 1 part of the game universe - ie no duplication of game area data within a shard. Right now, since each DGS is acting as a standlaone shard there are thousands of them, once Server Meshing goes in the number of shards will be massively reduced, only very high level 'universe wide' data will be duplicated between shards.

Can you see a possible limitation? Notice that for anything to happen anywhere in the game universe SOCS has to load those assets into server RAM and it only does that for areas where players are. If they left it that way nothing would happen in any part of the game where players aren't going, those areas would be permanently 'stuck in time'. That's what the Replication Layer is there to fix, it takes the constantly running 'whole universe simulation' data and sends it to the pCache so that there is dynamic change going on in the game universe whether there are players there to see it or not. Genius eh?

Now you can let your imagination run riot!
Suppose one of the game masters decides I'm going to make a meteor shower happen in the Ellis system at a certain time, on a certain date. There are no players in the Ellis system but with a few mouse clicks and checkboxes ticked that game master spawns a meteor shower that obeys the games physics, interacts with everything in the Ellis sytem it comes into contact with and it's effects are permanent. He decides he's going to get The Spectrum News to cover the event live so a server is spun up with the Ellis system and virtual cameras are placed there so that you can log in on your mobile to watch Spectrum News and see that meteor shower and it's effects. All the NPC's are simulated and because 'he's drawn that way' the UEE Senator for the Ellis system decides he's gonna get some political capital out of this so he gets himself in front of a Spectrum News camera calling on the UEE military for disaster relief support (this is what Tony Zurovec is doing - Quantum). You decide to go there, you arrive too late to see it - but you will see the aftermath effects of it, not only on physical objects, but also on the NPC population which are all reacting in real time in that backend virtual simulation set of events to be 'Replicated' into the live game simulation, on demand. No recurrent scripts running - "There are no Heimskr's in Star Citizen", this is a one-off event, and they can run them, and any variety of them anywhere they feel like, any time they feel like it. This whole universe simulation is always running, being recorded to the pCache ready for any part of it to be replicated to the live game for players to experience. It's wild!

In summary:
They haven't 'missed a chance' to do anything, what they have planned will allow not only what the OP is asking (which has always been the stated intent) but a whole lot more, things never seen in other games. The 'persistence' that CIG refer to isn't just item persistence in the game, it is the virtual always running game universe that is fully persistent, crash proofed at every level, infinitely expandable. It allows input from all directions - players - game masters (suns going nova, plagues, famines, gold rushes, politics with their effects persisting) - backend logic simulations of NPC populations (millions of unique characters going about their lives) and 'a partridge in a pear tree' to fully persist ad infinitum as long as that Replication Layer Gateway Service is running and has access to that pCache. Imagine it, a massively populated virtual universe where things happen constantly, everywhere and you can log in to that virtual simulation game, or watch it on your mobile - access in-game services on your mobile.

We are literally weeks (3.18 went Live on May 12th) into the most monumental change in online gaming history ever seen. If you've ever dreamed of actually living in the Star Trek or Star Wars universe, in real time - this, like no other, is the game project for you.

Have no fear, this thing is bigger than both of us, and you will get all you dream of, and more - much more! People will be raving in amazement at what becomes possible with this Leviathon of a system. It is going to be a role players, social media / content media maker's wet dream of a game, always something happening, always something to talk about, not just what the players are doing! - which means massive online exposure. It's so far out there and unheard of many can't wrap their head around it. It's going to take some time to fit all the puzzle pieces together, but they are going in slowly but surely. Try not to get bogged down with each current talking point technicality, see it in the big picture. How long? No-one has ever even attempted such a thing before, so how could anyone judge (including CIG) how long it will take. But the point is... the partnership between CIG and this community allows them to attempt the seemingly impossible.

1. The Issue Council is only one branch of player reported data, they have telemetry, they have analytics. The Issue Council only informs them that some players have an in issue, if that issue is already known and currently being worked on there is no need to leave multiple Issue Council reports open about it. How the players use the IC is not CIG's fault, multiple reports not reaching the threshold means those making those reports are doing two things, failing to search the IC effectively and failing to upvote the duplicates.

2. The game performance is affected by factors outside of CIG's control, such as player hardware and quality of the players internet connection. I'm afraid the 'my internet connection is good for everything else I do' is no guarantee that it is sufficient for this project. Many players don't have the same issues, the general assumption by players is that it is server performance issues, but this is just an assumption.

3. You say that you 'achieved nothing' but that isn't the case. You may not have achieved what you expected or wanted to achieve in the game but you did log in and supply CIG with player data in a WIP Alpha project. You added one more rice grain to the pile we will all eventually happily feed on in the future. We are all game testers whether we wish it weren't so or not. You did observe that the game responds differently during a server/client disconnect (30K), this helps to inform both you and other players that there is a difference between 'standard game client control inputs' and CIG's way of handling player client control inputs. Those who know why it happens that way can add the evidence of that difference to the pile. If you have learned why elevators, ASOP terminals and a plethora of other things don't work in the game due to network issues then hopefully the achievement is that you learned something.

If you approach this project from the standpoint of being purely 'a casual gamer' then you will suffer these frustrations (we all have them from time to time) - in his last Letter From The Chairman Chris did plainly state that the next year or so after PES was implemented would be a rough one. PES on it's own is a huge strain on server resources until it's 'balancing partner', server meshing, comes along to alleviate that strain. We're playing a bastardised hybrid of half built planned tech implementation and legacy CryEngine code. We're playing in a game that is partially built with completely new pieces not seen outside of this project, so yes they do take it to extreme breaking point on purpose.

If the process of game design itself is of interest then the achievement and satisfaction doesn't come from getting credits, ships, reaching a mission marker etc, it comes from knowing that uniquely in the game industry the player (you) are a partner in this process of striving for something so radically different... that yes... our grandkids will appreciate the efforts made, because it is going to change the gaming industry. That is the main intent of this project. Always has been.

I'm sure you are well aware there can be no permanent meaningful player progress right now or for the near future, so what's the angst about? In 6 to 12 months there definitely will be another full reset, perhaps even sooner. The 'game' is discovery.. ask why.. why is that Corsair doing that? Why don't the terminals work? Why is the game unresponsive to commands sometimes? If the act of asking 'why' motivates you to go and find out stuff, then you have achieved something better than a few credits, or a temporary ship to fly around in... and sure, you can bore your grandkids senseless with all that inside knowledge you picked up through the all trials and tribulations.

Yes I do stop to think that the videos are for the players, which is why I question the lack of informed practice. If the approach was to go to the base information given, then demonstrate that information as well as making comparison.. then all good. The community can be better informed by this trickle down of what is frankly confusing tech-speak to most.

Another aspect of the approach is to show change over time, is it any wonder Jared has chosen the strapline 'The only constant is change'. Yet Camural doesn't present it as such, he talks in terms of this is the way it is and doesn't talk about planned changes to come.

Yes, there are many things still not implemented, we know that, we tick a box numerous times before playing this Alpha WIP.

If CIG has a fault it is that they don't repeat, update or expand upon information already given especially since another of Jared's taglines is 'It's always someone's first show', inherent in that idea is that those for whom this is their first exposure to information about development are very unlikely to have a full picture of where development is right now or where it plans to go from the years and years of intensive information flow. A lot of the angst in the community is entirely due to this variance in each community contributors understanding of previous information given. CIG very rarely present their information in the context of the wider gaming industry practice so that anyone is not aware of 'standard practice' doesn't know the context or value of what CIG is doing. This is merely stating a fact, CIG are NOT taking the standard approach to many aspects of what they produce, it is not 'White Knighting' CIG. It is up to us to inform ourselves so that we can make our own judgements about whether one approach over another appeals to us. If you're fine with NPC's being clones, or if you don't mind loading screens, then that aspect of this project won't mean much to you.

The naysayers are constantly talking about comparing to other released games, even though they KNOW this is nowhere near a released game or final product. They talk about how long and how much money it has taken, yet completely ignore the differences between this project and 'other games'. Worse in my view they fail to analyse other game projects and point out the differences between industry standard approach to problem solving, and how what CIG are doing bucks the trend in researching, developing and implementing such an innovative approach... they simply dismiss it as Chris Roberts 'perfectionism'. Solving age old problems is not perfectionism, it is an attempt to drive the industry forward to take advantage of other innovations in the field of computer technology.

They also fail to point out the 'standard' segmented nature of computer game technology - usually innovations come from those who only job is to produce game engines that make games - then those tools are sold to game developers, there is a feedback loop. Example Sean Tracy did not originally work for CIG, he worked as 'Roving Ambassador to CryTek R&D team, his job was to feedback ideas for improvement of CryEngine to CryTek. CIG have brought all of this R&D in-house and it is ongoing while producing a live game product for mass use - this is unheard of, bringing R&D this close to the coal face to be tested in the fires of mass participation. This was the whole point of going the crowdfunded route because standard game development funding always takes the safe, known, tried and tested route where the 'suits' treat gamers as consumers of product rather than as a community of participators in the process - we don't have to do that. We don't have to accept that.

If you want to better inform player choices, you should start from that reality. If it is the case that simply saying 'we're not there yet' is seen as 'defending CIG', then frankly that kind of partisanship entrenched attitude is not worth engaging with. Reality is reality, it is not a defense of anything. Collectively the community and CIG gave ourselves the opportunity to push the bounds far beyond what standard game development funding would allow. Intrinsic in this idea of 'funding' is the time taken to research and develop new methods of achieving results that allow more freedom to the players. What seems trivial and unnecessary to some is a core element to others, each player makes the choice about what matters to them and there are thousands of games out there that allow a 'best fit' for their choices. If a cat lover joins a kennel club and starts preaching about the benefits of cat grooming it would be perfectly in order to suggest, maybe you're in the wrong place, with the wrong attitude? That wouldn't be 'white knighting' dog owners would it?

Another respondent above bemoans how terrible it is that CIG hasn't properly implemented hit scan / hit boxes in the game 'after 11years', this again fails to take into account that CIG are planning to completely do away with hit scan detection and hit boxes in Star Citizen and Squadron 42.

When they hear 'physicalisation' their mind goes to some limited notion of cargo boxes and backpack contents - but physicalisation touches far more than that.

When CIG first explained that bullets would be actually physicalized in the game - you load it into a magazine, it actually travels down the barrel and flies through whatever medium (and it's effects are applied to that bullet travel), it has weight and kinetic energy, they nod and think they have fully understood what that particular form of physicalisation refers to - but that isn't all it refers to. The bullet will not impact a 'hitbox' it will impact a physical object in the game and it's effect will be transferred to that physical object - permanently, the 'damage' is appropriate and at the exact site that the bullet hit affecting both the surface and underlying structure of that physicalized object, and even any object inside that object. The current in-game hitbox detection is legacy code from CryEngine. So great, take the time to examine that legacy code effect if you want, but maybe it would inform players better if you look at some innovation CIG HAS actually implemented and explain that?

Anyone who is satisfied with other game's way of registering hits will wonder why take years to research and develop this rigorously physicalised approach, it's because it allows things that other games don't allow, such as accurate response to external conditions like atmospheric density, gravity, ricochets, bullet fragmentation, bullet penetration, magazine loading and various types of propellant and bullet make up. It means you can have bullet holes in structures that aren't just a surface applied decal. You've gone from having a simulated scripted bullet travel to a reactive 'real world' bullet simulation.

This approach to full physicalisation affects so many things it's hard to wrap your head around it. Many gamers extrapolate the real world experience into their games, they assume it works in-game, in all games, like real life. Doesn't every game do it that way? - No, they absolutely do not! If you're surprised that a Pico held at arms length will stop a point blank bullet from a machine gun, then you haven't really looked at how other games work. It is not CIG's intended design that a Pico can be used as armor shielding. Even games, like flight simulators, that take account of weight and size of passengers and cargo don't fully simulate those objects, a script is applied to simulate them. Star Citizen aims to fully physicalise everything, which means that if your backpack is full of a certain object the mass of that object is taken account of when you place it aboard a ship. Inertia and impact damage will affect objects inside objects inside objects. If it doesn't blow your mind, you simply haven't understood it and you definitely haven't understood why this is radically different to what anyone else is doing or has done. Chris is doing the coding for this himself, will he do it? None of us can know, but it is his intent and the fact that anyone would even try to give such an experience to players is worth both the time and the money as far as those in the community who want a radically different approach to game simulation are concerned.

Camural's issue from my perspective is that he has failed to grasp the whole premise of the project fully before diving in to give his assessment based upon 'the wider gaming genre'. He thinks he's pointing out the flaws in CIG's intended design, which fails to take into account that the current game release is on a hybrised version of CryEngine, the faults he is drawing attention to are actually the limitations of that legacy CryEngine, but he either doesn't know that, or he fails to acknowledge it.

I think the majority view might be that the word 'wasted' is not appropriate. It depends upon your standpoint, and of course, your standpoint is one of ignorance of the true scope, scale and progress of Squadron 42 as it is for most of us. Example: Personally I think people spending millions on designing, developing and tool making for ICE powered cars is a complete waste of money and detrimental - others have different views.

Scope - as in the variety of things to do and see. The Stanton system has more scope than any other game in it's genre including some we know are planned and not released yet by much bigger development studios, and we know there is more to come. Example: they thought about putting refueling into Starfield and decided against it. The main rival games in the genre don't have such things as rivers, caves, race tracks etc. Yes there are plenty of small volume single world games out there to play, but they don't have the scale and intended variety.

Scale - the sheer volume of the intended playspace. We know there are many more systems to come, which if they have anywhere near the scope of the current Stanton system, or better, it will be unrivalled in the gaming industry as a whole, let alone in it's genre. How many times have we heard dev team members say on camera 'Are we allowed to talk about that yet?' the most obvious take from that is that there are things not yet revealed. The current Stanton system is not only a small test-bed, it is also only used for testing things that are not more suited for testing in Squadron 42.

The preparation work, and the duration of that work, to lay the foundations for a 4 bedroom house to a standard set of plans are very different to the preparations required for a massive bespoke office block. You also need a different toolset and a larger scope of skillsets. CIG are simultaneously making tools, systems and assets for 4+ games (while servicing a live alpha release, which is almost unheard of), not one, how cost effective is that? It's a franchise they are making, they are not merely 'building a game' from a known previously developed toolset.

Squadron 42 is not some standalone game completely separate in scale and scope from the multiplayer universe - like a Call of Duty single player is to it's multiplayer and mini mission maps. Squadron 42 takes place in the same game universe, so all it's contents will come to the PU minus the story elements. If we are considering 'value for money' in terms of game development that is a '2 for 1' scenario. I'm struggling to recall any two AAA standalone games that used the same assets in both.

Development up to now has consisted of:
Building the teams
Outfitting the premises
Building the design and the systems that support that design
Building the tools to make game assets and systems
Building and refining the pipelines

There is no wastage, those tools and pipelines will produce (probably are already) and they will do it faster and faster as the teams are expanded and trained. The money has been spent on making tangible assets that can produce time and time again, they are proprietary. They have solved issues that have plagued the game industry since it's inception, those toolsets are something other game design company's CEO's would sell their firstborn child to get a hold of.

People think of Chris Roberts as a game designer / builder, he isn't, he's a systems engineer. He has built a team of very advanced engineers to make tools that do things never dreamt of previously. In other games of this genre you have to have a skybox, which means loading screen to go from ground to space, their procedural planet tech production means no skybox, so no need for that loading screen, the atmosphere and amazing sunsets come as a bonus. He doesn't like to use the 'quick fix' solutions you find in other games if he can find a way to do it better or more realistically. The DNA system for example which had to solve the clipping / fitting problem you get when using standard game design tools. Star Citizen will have asymmetry in it's character creation and outfitting for all characters, not just the handmade bespoke characters.

He has told us that he (as in him doing the coding personally) is working on a system that allows accurate hit and damage representation to the player characters or their equipment, and that includes NPC's, rather than the industry standard hit boxes and pre-made damage states. Rebellion Developments were so impressed with their version of basically the same thing in Sniper Elite they made a whole game franchise out of it, Chris is doing it in his own time after work while running this multinational company. Play a racing car game and to you it looks like when you crash you cause damage, but that's because at the moment of impact the model is switched to one of many damage state models for that vehicle or part of that vehicle, that's why most racing games are in very very small areas with very low player counts to reduce loading times.

They have also mentioned they are working on rigid body deformation, that means you can crush, warp and bend things in the game according to forces applied - buckled landing gear, bent wings and ship hulls etc as well as having a physics model that supports those damage states. These are things normally only seen in tech demo's. If you talk to team members in person, as I have, they will tell you about the incredible scope and scale and how it is beyond anything they have ever seen - they aren't talking about the game, they are talking about about the toolsets the engineers have dreamed up that allow them to do things they've never been able to do with other companies they have worked for.

Crushing hulls in 'ship munchers' is several orders of magnitude more difficult to achieve than beam stripping from the surface of a ship or breaking each ship into it's damage state components, the fact they have even mooted the idea as possible, in a massively open world game, is quite frankly mind-blowing to anyone who understands how 3D meshes are made and used in game engines. Innovations like these come rarely to existing game creation engines. I listened carefully to Todd Howard's presentation about Starfield which uses the Creation Kit - the same Skyrim Creation Kit you can go and download yourself, the changes to that toolset are fairly minor - Starfield is being made with basically the same toolset as Skyrim V was... according to Todd Howard's own words. Bethesda's NPC's can use ladders now! If Todd Howard knew that the Creation Kit now accurately modelled thruster outputs on ship models he would be shouting it from the rooftops, because he knows the Creation Kit never supported such a functionality before.

Of course this all brings us to the oft quoted 'It's taking too long!' chant. Since this project started Chris and his team have been described as 'certifiably insane', 'batshit crazy', and 'out there!' with respect to what they are attemptiong to make. How long does batshit crazy, certifiably insane and out there take to make? No-one really knows because no-one else has been batshit crazy, certifiably insane 'out there' enough to even try. We have no yardstick to measure how long it 'should take' or how much it 'should cost'. All we know is that despite all the naysayers they just keep doing it, making things happen the way they said they planned to make it happen.

In the beginning of a project you need very highly skilled (read rare and expensive) people for those first stages, but as the tools are made then far less experienced people (cheaper) can be trained specifically to use the tools produced, as experienced team members become more familiar with the tools and assets their production rate increases too. We've seen this happen. There is a big difference between procedural generation and procedural production, the majority of work to date has gone on R&D 'under the hood', the scale, scope and type of R&D you just don't find elsewhere.

Does he? Or does he simply not keep up to date and informed well enough to know what to expect before he dives in? Where is the value to the dev teams in that? Proving / demonstrating something they already know very well?

There are plenty of good things to test, which could inform players about how the game currently works and what changes are happening, even basic bug searching, but in order to figure out how to do THOSE tests he'd have to update and inform himself.

He treats Star Citizen like it is a released 'standard game' not a completely different Alpha WIP. With lots of features still to go in. It's a shame he doesn't, all those efforts wasted only to be told 'Yeah, no shit Sherlock. We know'.

The method is fine, it's the things he chooses to test that reveal he doesn't really inform himself. There's no armour implemented and even though there is an on-screen HUD depiction of segmented damage it's just for show, there is only a basic damage score, it doesn't matter where you shoot a player or NPC unless it's a head shot (in Star Citizen the head and body are two separate entities), yet he tested it extensively. Anyone could have told him, you can shoot a players hand/glove until they die because the planned disablement mechanic isn't in yet. We know the armour pieces only affect overall damage points, which is a placeholder mechanism. We have been told.

There is a quote from Chris Roberts which became a meme - "Yeah. No shit! We know it's missing!"

The system described on the AtV has not changed, only expanded.

As stated by others you will connect to your regional AWS hub for account authentication, all internet connections to CIG services then run through the AWS backbone. There are only a few countries that don't have an AWS edge service (the thing you initially connect to), the majority do. The map below shows AWS hubs.

Since that show something else has changed, the way the player client and services interact.

Normally in most multiplayer games you would connect to a game service and any change you make via your game client takes place first on your PC game client and you see the result of that input immediately. That 'change state' is then passed to the game service which then sends out that change state to all connected clients so that they can see the result of your actions. This is where lag comes from. If someone has a slow connection they see the result of their action a significant time before any other players sees the result of that action. If you (or any other player) have a symmetric connection your up and down lag are additive so a 250ms up plus a 250ms down appear as a half a second lag.

If you take careful note of how Star Citizen handles inputs you will see that there is a wait period between you initiating a command on your PC local client and you seeing the result of that command - for certain things. You will also notice that during any period of time you are disconnected from the Star Citizen game services (a 30K before the game client wait to connect timer runs out) there are certain actions you simply can't do, like call an elevator, use your inventory, turn on your ship, QT jump, open a door or even fire a weapon. To differentiate between what is client first and 'server first' all you have to do is note what you can and can't do when disconnected. For example you can be injured and continue bleeding out and running while disconnected, but you can't use a medpen while disconnected.

The reason this happens is because Star Citizen changed the way they handle player input commands to avoid the advantageous effects of internet connection lag. Now instead of you inputting a command and seeing the result of that command first, that command is sent down the network to the game services first, there is a wait timer to collect all inputs from players within a given time period. Those commands are then executed in the game world and only then are the results of those actions sent down to each connected game client, including you. So while a player may have an input lag of 250ms, it won't make any/much difference to other players because you, and all other players, only see the result of that action after the Dedicated Game Server initiated it and informed all connected clients simultaneously.

Players do not connect directly to the DGS shards, they connect through the hub, then the Hybrid Service (which will become the Replication Layer Gateway Service -RL). The RL then updates the DGS's on each shard and the persistence layer simultaneously and only once that process has completed are players informed simultaneously of change states in the game world through the Hybrid service to each hub and connected client. If you check on the RSI main page you will see a diagram of how the shard services are arranged (look for the topic 'Server Meshing') and you will see that players only connect to the Replication Layer Gateway Service on that diagram. There are other backend services that also affect the game world and they also feed into the RL

There are very good reasons for organising it this way and they mostly have to do with how many backend simulations feed into the game world, like Quantum, Quasar and the Full Persistence services etc.

While you may be able to move or peek around a corner sooner than any other player sees it, you can't shoot the other player until they 'see you' shoot unless they have a particularly bad 'down' ping rate. Everything in the game is physicalised which means it is tracked and recorded in the persistence database millisecond by millisecond. Player clients are informed of those changes simultaneously only once the changes take effect in the game world. In effect when you input a command you are requesting that change, but the confirmation of any change request only comes down to you (and all other connected clients) after the game world has registered it.

The system can group players by ping rate.

The majority of issues we see in the game currently, what people refer to as 'lag', isn't actually standard game lag it is the backend systems network communication between the new systems they have put in place to support full persistence that is the issue. They are gradually working through those issues, it's a brand new system only put in place on the Live servers since March 10th. Plenty of time yet to iron out any backend network issues.

TL:DR
Standard game server lag does not exist in Star Citizen because of the way the game services and executing player commands are structured. You do see ships jumping around (teleporting), and it looks a lot like standard server lag, but this is because the ships position and orientation are being updated from those backend services and they are struggling to keep up with current events - 'getting out of sync' as the dev's call it. Players see weapon fire whizz past them yet it records a hit, that's because the backend persistence services had you in that position to be hit the last time they received an update about your ships position. There is evidence that ship move commands have been changed very recently from 'client first' like player move commands, to 'server first' and this is why some are reporting 'a bug' that their ship becomes unresponsive to inputs when that backend network is struggling. It has almost nothing to do with player ping rates.

The inner thought is being reworked it was shown off in the last presentation of the last CitizenCon with Chris and Richard Tyrer. they also said we would have customisation of the controls. Simply looking at an item will highlight it, and they actually said they were making it the same way it works in other games.

Downstream teams get work allocated in 3 month chunks, upstream teams get work allocated in 6 month chunks. The Engineering Team is an upstream team so the progress Tracker for their work assignments gets updated in June.

There are three terms you have to grasp to understand how Star Citizen works and why it is different to other games:
Player Client Authoritative
Server Authoritative
Service Authoritative
Player Client Authoritative
Most online games use a player client authoritative approach. You press a key, your game client carries out that action to cause a change in the state of an entity in your game, like a ship - say 'pitch up'. That changed state is then sent to the server where it is passed to any player clients (and NPC's) connected who should see the result of that pitch up command. This leaves the system open to server lag, where the player sees something happen first and other players only see the result of that action afterward. Star Citizen used to work this way too but it was changed. It is also the case that most games (not all) spin up servers in a fixed 'level designer built state' that has no persistence, which is again the way Star Citizen used to work before PES.
Server Authoritative
Initially Star Citizen changed to Server Authoritative. The player presses a key, that command is sent to the server and once the server has collected all those commands within a set time frame then that change state command is sent out to all connected players who in theory should now see the pitch up response simultaneously. This is why nothing responds in the game while waiting for the 30K timeout notification of client / server disconnection. We know they must have changed the ship move commands from Client Authoritative to Service Authoritative because of the no response (or very very slow response) to ship control inputs. The only thing remaining client authoritative is the player move commands from what I can see.
Service Authoritative
Once the Hybrid Service (precursor to the Replication Layer Gateway Service often referred to simply as the Replication Layer) was connected to the DGS (Dedicated Game Server shards) and Entity Graph (PES) the system was changed again. Now the player command goes to the Hybrid Service which stands between the player and server where it is then sent simultaneously to the DGS shard and Entity Graph. Example: Once your ship crosses a certain boundary near a landing area the Hybrid Service knows where you are and it knows to contact the ATC Service, you can now request to land. When you do that the ATC service decides if there is a hangar available and assigns it to you, when you approach close enough to the correct hangar door it opens them for you. When you land on a pad it registers you have landed. In the PTU build I last played the ATC Service didn't respond or assign me a hangar until I'd flown back down to Hurston, then it kept telling me every few minutes "All our landing pads are full" for about 30 minutes until I disconnected.

Once the change state has been acknowledged that change state is then passed back through the Hybrid Service and out to all connected player clients. The Hybrid Service (and later the RL to come) is a live microsecond by microsecond recording service that collects and registers the change state of all the entities in the game world (think of it as an active game save for the whole game world), absolutely everything is recorded.

The Entity Graph is the 'hard copy' recording of all those change state inputs which is needed because DGS shards spin down, or stream game areas out of RAM when there is no player present. If an area of a game is not in active server RAM then no changes can take place except through the simulated game world services (Quantum / Quasar etc) inputting into the Hybrid Service and Entity Graph. This allows changes to happen in the game universe even in places where there are no players present, it's the gods eye view on the game universe. The thing that is being 'replicated' is the always running backend game universe simulation onto the live game servers so that players can interact with that running simulation.

When players don't understand how the game system works, when they seem to have no response to an input they just keep spamming inputs, which of course makes the situation worse. Often if you just wait, and wait you'll see the response to the input, sometimes several minutes later depending on how overloaded the backend network is.

...
Why do it this way?

1. To cut down on apparent player to player lack of simultaneity caused by network lag.

2. So that change states can be recorded to a database service (PES) so that when a server spins up the Shard Manager Service loads the fixed assets made by the level designer, inputs from any other services like the NPC Scheduler or the Mission Service, and then queries the Entity Graph through the Replication Layer Gateway Service to bring that server up to date with the exact up to the microsecond game world state ie Full Persistence - before any player is loaded in.

If there is a failure (or slowdown) of network traffic between the player client, the Hybrid Service and DGS shard or Entity Graph then any actions taken by the player will not appear to work, it looks like good old server lag in extremis but it isn't. It's neither a game client bug nor a game server build bug, or game server state problem relating to control commands, it's a network / service issue between the services responsible for controlling the game state.

3. It also means that if a player is disconnected from a server shard because it has crashed they are still connected the Hybrid Service ready to transfer to another server that is running, or after a short period of non-responsiveness in the game another server is spun up to the exact state the server crashed in and the players are transferred to the new server, which looks exactly like the crashed server.

This is why they keep saying the databases are getting out of sync with what is supposed to be happening in the game world because they monitor all inputs to the Hybrid Service (which have time stamps) and can check any mismatch between it and the DGS and Entity Graph etc.

We have to remember they are building a live system that is supposed to run uninterrupted for years and years, that's why every service and system has to have a live back up to restore from immediately if that part of the system goes down... that's why it's referred to as 'The Living Breathing Universe'. Once it goes live it never stops, it will be always changing even if there are no players around those areas to see those changes take place.

In his last Letter From The Chairman Chris warned everyone that while all the services underpinning Full Persistence were being put in and bug fixed, it would be a rocky road, it is a massively complex suite of network connected systems. Each part of the system cannot be put in piece by piece and expected to work flawlessly, they have to go in together and be synchronised.

For example: As we can see on the Progress Tracker we could confidently say they are still working on the DGS Crash Recovery Service, if they had it in place and working well with the Hybrid Service and/or Entity Graph we wouldn't see 30k's anymore unless it was a player client ISP connection that failed:

When we consider that Persistent Entity Streaming only went live with 3.18.0 on March 10th of this year, the huge restructuring of how the live game service works and the sheer number of backend services that have to be removed from the DGS's and plugged in to that new structure...
The NPC Scheduler Service
The ATC Service
The Persistent Entity Streaming Service (a whole suite of new services)
The Shard Manager Service
The ASOP Terminal Service (which they re-organised)
The Player Inventory Service
The Mission Service (and added new missions)
The Error Reporting Service
The Player Authorisation Service

..to name but a few, there's loads of them, it's amazing they have the game to a reasonably playable state for the majority, even if it staggers a few times under huge player loads. All while providing a live game environment service, with ongoing events! ...and they are adding more stuff to the game while still working on that restructured network system, with Server Meshing to come. It boggles the mind, it's only been 2 months since 3.18.0 went live! Think of the forward planning that must have gone into restructuring all those moving parts - which mechanic is expected to completely rebuild a brand new engine into a car, while the car is running? Think of the massive amounts of error codes they must have had to wade through from every system involved in the delivery of that live game service, to be able to bug fix it enough to get it to where it is now.

Cut them some slack please. They've reached a milestone in this race no other game developer would even attempt.

As another has said above Squadron 42 is not multiplayer so it does not need the same amount of backend resources and network traffic. The current problems with the servers are all about those backend network connections to the persistence database and other services that put things into the game.

Some things causing high network traffic will just go away when those temporary systems are taken out of the game, for example when you open your inventory or a loot box all those items are handled by a service that doesn't run on the DGS's, when things are fully physicalised rather than in a remote inventory database that problem goes away, and it won't be an issue with Squadron 42 there won't be thousands of players all requesting a ship at the ASOP terminals, checking out loot boxes or opening their inventory. There will be no mission service providing activities for thousands of players running in Squadron 42 as there is for the PU.

There a few other things to note however:

The game runs in a version of the StarEngine that is no different to the multiplayer, there will be no huge amount of work to bring things already made for Squadron 42 to the PU. Some things will need updating because Squadron 42 takes place in the past and the Squadron 42 assets don't include anything the player won't visit in a star system. As Jared Huckaby said.. "Squadron 42 is basically one giant dynamic mission in the Star Citizen universe".

If you go to the main page you will find a link to where they describe their plan for how the backend services for the PU will be structured, from it you will see that no player will connect directly to the DGS, we will connect to the Replication Layer Gateway (RL)* and that sends update information both to the persistence layer and the DGS's, this is to allow players to see events and actions of other players all at the same time. Squadron 42 is not multiplayer there is no need for other players to see the result of any action taken by other players - therefore the RL and Persistence Service aren't needed. It will still be an online game because account authentication and saves will be handled remotely by CIG.

The Star Citizen universe is dynamic, it will have network connected services that cause change over time like Quantum and Quasar, the Squadron 42 game is not dynamic, all events are scripted, it doesn't need to connect to those services.

Loot boxes and inventories (and all the network bandwidth they take up) are a temporary solution for the lack of server meshing, if the contents of those boxes and inventories were all physicalised into the game now the entity count per server would go even higher, all of which has to be loaded into server RAM and they take up CPU runtime for collisions etc. When server meshing frees up server RAM and CPU runtime those items can be physicalised and you will find them scattered around the game environment - on shelves, in lockers, inside storage boxes etc. You won't be able to magic drag anything into the game that isn't already present once everything is physicalised, otherwise what would be the point of cargo lifts and trollies if you can just throw everything into your inventory while you run around?

Object Container Streaming will still be active in Squadron 42, and ship interior culling, so that only entities local to a single player need to be loaded. This is not the case with the PU servers which have to load all assets into server RAM in the Stanton system if players spread out over the whole system - this is a major part of what server meshing is meant to address, reducing RAM load on each DGS in the PU shard. If you have a large fleet battle in space in Squadron 42 it means that no landing zones, planets, moons, distant space stations and their contents etc need to be loaded into RAM, and of course no other players and the things they bring with them - which means much more 'battle specific' entities can be loaded into RAM.

* What will become the full Replication Layer Gateway Service is currently handled by something called 'The Hybrid Service' which is a temporary service until the RL is fully connected to the Persistence Service and the DGS's, some of the communication with the Persistence Service still runs on the DGS's - those will be moved to the Replication Layer Gateway Service and off the DGS's.

These questions have been addressed.

Quarterdeck prison. A prison planet run by the UEE military. For capital offences.

Squadron 42 has the ships brig.

The PU currently has Klescher Rehabilitation Facility eventually for fairly minor infractions. The punishments are not much of a deterrent now, but that will change.

There are security checkpoints throughout the verse wherever you access facilities or travel between systems, they are not active now but they will be. DNA tech means that facial recognition will be a thing.

There will be a reputation system and character history that will not only affect how NPC's treat you but also affect what work you can undertake and places you can go. Serving your time for a crime will not remove the history of criminal behaviour from your log.

There are levels of social status: 'no status within the UEE', Civilian of the UEE, Citizen of the UEE. Citizenship can be revoked by the UEE even if you have paid for it or earned it. A criminal history will cause citizenship to be revoked. "Service Guarantees Citizenship". Citizens pay less tax, they can vote in Imperator and Senatorial elections, citizens in good standing with UEE can own and operate 'essential to the UEE' production nodes.

A history of military service. There is no way to join the services except by starting Squadron 42. During military service you gain training and licenses / security clearances which will determine which ships you are legally allowed to own and operate in UEE controlled systems. Certain UEE systems will require you to have a clean rep and/or security clearances. Certain equipment and access to databases will likewise be restricted and this will affect what contracts you can undertake from the UEE agencies.

When you consider that a history of lawless behaviour will restrict your access to services, locations, military grade equipment, work contracts and possibly in-verse events it will occur to many that style of play carries too high a price even if they are willing to serve their sentence.

Star Citizen will not be an 'anything goes' no rules type of MMO. The UEE is a militaristic empire, they will not allow unfettered access to equipment or services that could become a threat to the UEE forces by undesirables, they will not be allowed to disrupt vital trade routes. The oft quoted 9 to 1 ratio is only an average. Players will be the minority just about everywhere they go. If the lore of a place says it is heavily populated they would not reduce the NPC population to 90 just because there are only 10 players in that location.

Comparing Star Citizen to other games serves no purpose, it will not be like other games and it won't even be anything like the current Alpha.

We got some information about Squadron 42 from Chris Roberts and Richard Tyrer at the end of the last digital CitizenCon - 2hrs and 16 minutes long.

Work on player and NPC animations on ladders and mantling.
Fighting creatures.
The new EVA
AI search and cooperate / environment aware tech.
Short, medium and long range scanning with Quantum Boost - no QT marker required.

..are the ones that spring to mind.

er... apparently you and your Org are participating in Jumptown. 
â
 So.. what? Self termination?

Empathy toward the player base as a whole should include helping the development team to get all network issues bug fixed and ironed out surely? After all it's possible that some of that future player base hasn't even signed up yet.

What we know they are working on:

NPC's will be environment aware, they will have personal histories, preferences and back stories. They all have a 24 hour day schedule.

They have done work (It was mentioned in an ISC and on the Progress Tracker) on making procedurally generated facial movements using data from wave files. CIG have already mentioned their interest in text to synthetic speech, but have been non-committal about it probably because it would include negotiating licenses with third parties. They did recommend Voice Attack with HCS Voice Packs and featured it on an Around The Verse if memory is correct. Voice Attack takes pre-written dialogue and uses the pre-recorded audio files to generate voice responses locally on the players machine. It can also use the local Microsoft TTS API to produce audio from text files.

We have VOIP and the resultant streaming of audio data.

They have done extensive work to make Render To Texture for real time face to face communications between NPC's and players. In the Squadron 42 vertical slice mission with directors commentary Chris states that the holographic call between Sato khan and Captain White is being streamed live and if you could get to Sato Khan's lair while the call was in progress you could photobomb that call. Odd thing to say? eh? Normally in single player games that call would be simulated by an in-place animation, not real time.

About Chat GPT in Skyrim:
ChatGPT makes written content for NPC's that is fed into the dialogue box wheel of possible responses in the modded versions of Skyrim. A script* is written by either Bethesda or the modder (I know because I've used the Skyrim Creation Kit) so that when certain dialogues are chosen it either opens up scripts for certain actions or closes down scripts or certain actions, I am not aware that scripts can be written 'on the fly' while the game executable is running so it's difficult to see how ChatGPT can be used to trigger scripts 'live', I am willing to be educated on the matter I suppose the script tags could be included in the dialogue written by Chat GPT, but from what I can see it will just include pre-written (by Chat GPT) and stored text responses specific for triggering scripts along with some general chit chat responses.

I know that normally audio files for voiced dialogue have to be loaded into the Skyrim directory tree prior to running the game executable, again I'm unaware if any modders have created an on demand text-to-speech API hook up (I'm Googling it to find out). All modded Skyrim V NPC's have voice acted pre-recorded files to play voice audio. I have written and recorded audio using voice changing software for characters in Skyrim V, I didn't release them as mods for others to use. I've also recorded audio for Voice Attack to use as responses using online TTS and voice changing software.

Skyrim V is not a dynamic world, nothing happens unless the player is present and interacting all in-game entity change states are recorded locally on the players save game file. Star Citizen is planned to be dynamic, things will happen even when players aren't around in a permanently running parallel background simulation of the game world - Quantum, this is a part of the reason why full persistence is required. Occasionally the dev team talk about 'game masters' for Star Citizen, this is what that means, dynamic on demand events they can plug into the game as it is running. NPC's will react to and talk about those dynamic events going on in the game world, they will also have access to the players history and reputation. They will respond to such things as the contents of the Spectrum. Some may remember the last Imperator election, we were told the AI population votes in Imperator elections, so somehow they are aware of the political 'goings on' and presumably they would be vocal about them.

Future possibility:
From an injection of text content for NPC's to yak about Chat GPT would be somewhat superfluous in Star Citizen because the NPC's already have a CIG generated database planned. If CIG do use the Microsoft TTS API to convert the contents of that database to wave files on demand then far from being left behind they would be ahead of the current capability of ChatGPT because it would be inbuilt for NPC's to give dynamic voice responses appropriately.

The real question is: Will players be able to use the Microsoft voice recognition API to input into the game as Voice Attack does? If they can do that then all of Voice Attacks functionality would be native to the game, but unlike VA if they could stream in text data to that API then you have a natural voice to voice interaction possible with NPC's appropriate to the whole game world.

We'll just have to wait and see, but there must be some reason they are going to the trouble of researching wave file to facial animation capability, even if it is to mass produce facial animation for NPC's to use. FOIP for NPC's? At a previous CitizenCon in 2018 they demonstrated how all NPC's can use any facial animation created for any character because of the standardised DNA tech they have created. If they use a combination of voice altering software (readily available) from recorded wave files, or even streamed audio, they can create a multitude of voices to deliver the same dialogue with the same facial animation, they just need to build a text database of all possible responses (I suppose they could use ChatGPT for that, but why bother?).

My estimate of what they seem to be doing, or planning, is making audio responses procedural ie CIG's usual approach to making mass production for consumption. One of the databases that NPC's will probably have access to is the Galactapedia. If they did create a mammoth database of recorded audio to be played locally on the players game client the game download would be gigantic, so a steamed on demand audio approach (like VOIP for NPC's) would seem to make more sense.

*Scripts refers to machine code - iirc written in Python using Boolean logic.

EDIT
It appears they have indeed made a hook up TTS mod for Skyrim V.

Buoyancy, waves, boats and swimming were all on the Roadmap Progress Tracker slated for both Squadron 42 and the PU. So expect to see it first in Squadron 42. The work on waves was mentioned in the last monthly reports. Yes, according to the information given about the Origin 890 Jump at concept, it is supposed to be able to float on water.

They have explained this only twice on video, so it's not surprising some may have missed it.

The issue is Raymarching they do a quite frankly insane amount of shooting out rays to sample pixels for draw calls, hence all the beautiful screenshots of sunrises and sunsets, the draw calls have too much detail out to great distance because the rays are sampling at multiple depths - thousands of kilometers and multiple translucent layers - which is unheard of, way further than other games and even flight simulators do. MSFS and X-Plane have the same issues and they have nowhere near the same level of ground detail that this game has, they use cell technology and LOD's (the further away the lower the resolution and they don't do transparency at lower resolution LOD's so their rays don't penetrate beyond the first few layers ie a few hundred kilometres, they also use global illumination to an extent that SC does not). They have ideas for fixing it, which sounds kinda smart in a 'no compromises' sort of way, but those ideas will not be worth attempting or implementing until the full Gen12 renderer is in. Once that happens they can start to optimise.

They have also mentioned the solutions they plan are for the next generation of hardware beyond todays - so if someone is playing the game on a 2000 series, or even a 3000 series mid range GPU they will realise that they are 3 or more generations back from what is intended for the final release. Harsh I know, but there it is. I fully expect minimum specs will be for an 8c/16t CPU, 3080 or 6800 XT with a minimum of 12GB VRAM and 32GB RAM.

I agree. They should make the reclaim times on fighters / gun ships 5 hours and spawn them with no weapons and components. /s

It's not fair to punish the poor meek, what are they gonna do when we inherit the universe huh? Huh?

Master Mode will be for high speed short range travel. QT will only be for long range travel. So no, they don't need a QT drive, they need the new flight system they have in Squadron 42 for testing.

Some may not be aware, currently only maneuvering thrusters work, the main engines glow is for show - the main engines are more powerful but they aren't active in the game yet.

They do have a clean up system, it's called the Density Manager - it was explained by M. Bausejour of Turbulent. Of course it will need some adjustment to fit the current circumstances once they have the network issues sorted.

As others have said above we all currently in a fish bowl but it won't remain that way forever. We've put up with worse 'pro tem' issues.

I'm looking forward to Starfield, I played Skyrim V for years, but the idea that is on the same scale and has the same scope of Star Citizen is just a non-starter. It doesn't have persistence beyond the player game save, there is no way you could describe it as a 'Living Breathing Universe'.

Ha ha ha... We already know that isn't the case from what Todd Howard has told us himself.

100 star systems, each with a loading screen to get to, and a loading screen to land and take off.

100 star systems and "4 fully built cities you can explore". A whopping 4 in the whole game!

Starfield is a single-player game, with scripted story line side missions and crafting just like Skyrim V.

He told us they are using a modified version of Creation Engine , and when he talks about those modifications the most prominent thing he mentions is being able to 'use ladders'.

He did talk about being able to land anywhere on planets, which is cool, but did anyone listen to how they actually achieve this? They are using a modified version of the cell system they use in Skyrim V. The cell system for Skyrim V (unmodded) used blocks of 4GB to load into RAM your surroundings all objects NPC's etc, if you stand in the middle of a cell only that cell and the cells immediately adjacent to yours are loaded into RAM - thus there is no long range gameplay possible - you won't be doing a lot of 'Hard Flying' over thousands of kilometres of terrain without heavy RAM loading in (leading to popping in), which is why there is minimal atmospheric flight planned in Starfield. Have they shown us any video of ships flying over planetary surfaces at speed, don't you think they would have if they could?

With the new system you'll have to choose a landing spot on the planet and that landing spot cell is loaded while in the flight down to surface - ergo, a loading screen. They don't have Object Container Streaming in the same way Star Citizen does. They are using the same type of technology used in Everspace 2 and No Mans Sky. It was actually the same technology originally planned for Star Citizen but dropped when procedural planets became a possibility in 2016. So, from a Star Citizen perspective it is out of date abandoned technology.

Given that the focus of testing is Persistent Entity Streaming, what would be the point of introducing the new flight model for large scale player testing right now?

Yes, every step, not every minute. Sharing is giving information, that doesn't necessarily mean putting it out into a game build.

Actually it does. Or rather it takes a mass of players to reproduce those issues, because those player commands are not executed client side first. The player command to get out of your seat or ATC request goes to the server first, this causes a 'change state' to be made via the backend network, once that change state is recorded the effect is then sent back to the players game client and you see the result of it. Same with the ASOP terminals.

They are aware they are having outages, it's on the status page. They have been working on it even over the weekend.

Will that personal medical elderly care staff or electric wheelchairs to push them onto the stage? 


You have no idea what the remuneration rates are at CIG, this is an assumption you have made. They also do not have a problem recruiting all up the ladder more than any other game developer. If you had watched the introduction to the new Montreal Team you would know that - that team came from other more established game development companies and they were fairly experienced. A significant proportion of the dev team have all worked for other game development companies, there is nothing stopping them leaving to find a different job if they want to. They now have more than one team working in Montreal which is a hot-bed region for game developers, so the competition is high. They recruit young for a reason told to me by Jared Huckaby, which has more to do with that they find that those who have worked for the more traditional development companies can often bring ideas and practises that don't fit with the ethos of a community driven project. Most adapt, but not all of them.

Whether you know it or not you are pushing the misinformation of the FUDspreaders here who when they couldn't halt the inflow of players and supporters tried to change tactics to poison the well for possible future recruits to the project. They have no evidence for their claims, they have made false assumptions from bits of gossip.

I am a retired drug and alcohol addiction counsellor, if someone lies to me or tries to evade giving an answer I know it. I talked to Jared Huckaby at a BarCitizen last year - alone. I asked him straight out "Did we do a good thing? Or has it all become too corporate now?" I could read from his face, he was shocked by the idea - he said No, the company has expanded but the original 'all one family together' ethos has not changed at all. If you go look there is an interview with a former employee of CIG who got into difficulty, they supported him throughout his difficulty for several months until he was capable of returning to work... and that was in the USA.

There is no other game development company that allows dev team members unrestricted access to it's community of players the way Chris Roberts does, and they know it.

I have met quite a few of the dev team members several times since Dec 2015, they are more than happy to tell anyone they love working at CIG, they have opportunities to stay longer with the company and develop their skills rather than years of working for the corporates who'll lay them off for a cost-cutting exercise. Normally in the industry they have to go job-hopping to get a promotion or take a drop to go learn different skillsets. At CIG they don't have to do that, they get internally promoted and can even switch roles within the company. They consider it the best career choice they ever made from what they've told me. Yes, some do move on, they may have personal reasons for that. It happens in all walks of professional life but we don't get to know the dev team members from other companies do we?

The physicalisation of everything is important for the overall experience, but it isn't the only part of this game universe that will both surprise and captivate.

There is a tendency to give the same weight to information CIG gives out, especially about their priorities, and not really take it all in full context. For example we all know that server meshing is coming and it is seen as one more step toward the finished game, whatever people perception of that is - but actually the absolutely necessary tech to make the planned game universe isn't quite so linear.

If server meshing were to somehow not become a reality they can still split off servers by having loading screens during QT and Jump Gates, no-one would want that but overall it wouldn't unduly adversely affect the planned gameplay experience - this is the shortcut Bethesda are making with Starfield. When you make a single player game, which is basically a version of Skyrim with a different genre, the player save game is the stand in for full persistence but it doesn't allow any evolution. All the other stuff like FOIP/VOIP, DNA tech, etc are icing on the cake, the sort of icing on the cake that doesn't get done with game publishers usually because their attitude is that while core tech is being made they'll just lay off teams not involved in the core tech to save money. This community said loud and clear, there's no need for that type of practise we'll keep supplying the necessary support, you just keep making it better.

The absolutely essential to the plan for the Star Citizen gameplay experience tech pillars are/were:
64bit precision
Spherical grid planets / moons
Nested physics grids within physics grids
Object Container Streaming
Server Object Container Streaming
Full Persistence

What will be unique about Star Citizen is that it will be a living breathing ever evolving 'feel real' universe, where the players aren't the main driving force and there is nothing like that out there. The game you play in all the other games mentioned is the same game universe every single day you play from the first to the last. Yes you may progress in that game universe, there may be large groups of players affecting that game universe, but it's the same universe. Full persistence was required to make this evolution over time a possibility, it touches everything and allows everything . All the other stuff like aging ships, parts wearing out they just naturally fall out of that system, they are obvious addons when the capability allows.

This is the difference between CIG's approach to making a game, they make systems that allow many opportunities and expansion rather than sitting down writing a fixed script and sticking to that doggedly until the end. It's a completely different approach. Rather than saying - what does our budget and current tech allow, they think in terms of what would we ultimately like the freedom to do? What underpinning tech do we need that would allow that? OK - let's look into that rather than rushing to get a product to market ASAP and satisfying investors. Star Citizen doesn't have to make big profits after release, there are no investors waiting with their hands out, whatever revenue the games bring in goes right back into those games. It's uniqueness is that it is self-funding for as long as the player community wishes it to be so.

The community bought that freedom to explore the possible and that is what makes this project unique, the dedicated support of it's community. Chris could have gone with the traditional investor/publisher route, but he knew if he trusted the community and his team he could do so much more for the people who want that ultimate experience.

Star Citizen (and to an extent Squadron 42) is not planned to be 'a' game it is going to be all games in one, whatever activity you can do in any other game of any genre there will be a version of it in Star Citizen because all the core features for all those games have been built in from the start. You can play Deus EX and there is a half basketball court and a basketball in the game, but you can't actually do much with it, it's set decoration. When they make a basketball court for the Javelin, you know they will make sure you can do something with it eventually, because that's how they roll. When they put out in wheeled vehicles they know what players will do with them, so they make racetracks, not because it was part of some big plan but because they could while they wait for other teams to finish their work.

Part of the reason people like working at CIG is that they know they won't get laid off work when priorities shift focus, they'll be allowed to explore different avenues and this allows them to progress in their careers. It gives them a sense of loyalty toward the project.

I'm looking forward to Starfield, I played Skyrim for many hundreds of hours, but it will not affect how people respond to Star Citizen - quite the opposite it might bring Skyrim fans into the genre who will then look at the hugely expansive role playing opportunities of Star Citizen. I have to smile at the reference to Elite Dangerous, if it's such a 'finished game' why are it's player number dwindling to less than 4000? Why have so many ED players and streamers switched and come over to Star Citizen even in it's unfinished state? It's because they know it is coming to 'end of life' there's no more plans to develop it for console, and no further statement of plans to expand it for PC.

There is an assumption made that Chris had a vision of a game (much more limited in scope than currently, basically the same thing as Starfield is going to be) and that after that game was made there wouldn't be any expansion of that game, but that isn't the case, it was always the plan to keep expanding it. When he realised certain things became possible that he couldn't have known in the earliest days he realised that core technology would allow that expansion to a greater degree sooner and doing it earlier would mean not having to rewrite everything when it came to expanding the game experience.They did release a playable game in Dec 2015 that had more features than the planned original even if it was much much smaller in scope.

If you're wanting a discussion about character slots and their potential sales you have to have that discussion within the wider context of the plan for this project.

This speaks to the character of the game, it is not about simply acquiring things it is about living an experience. You can choose what experience you want in the game universe, those who want to can have variety in their experience. You may find that you've taken your player character in a direction and it has had unintended (by you) consequences, you may decide to start again with a new character. There is no replay for choices you make, it is intended that for both Squadron 42 and the PU those choices once made have long lasting consequences. Players will be spending a lot of time pawing over and scrutinising, and even comparing their characters histories. In Squadron 42 you don't play a named character, you play your own character taking a role in history. Hence the 'Lieutenant' problem.

You're not paying for a game, you're paying for the right to create unique characters, each with their own unique histories in the whole Star Citizen / Squadron 42 universe.

Many assume and espouse the idea that this game project will not take an approach that is different to traditional games, but it will. Full persistence isn't just about coffee cups and salvaging, it's about a full living breathing universe that evolves over time. This is a radically different idea to just about any other game where the game world experience is the same on day 1 as it will be on day 3651. You will live a life in this game universe, you will become emotionally attached to characters and invested in not just your own characters but the wider living breathing universe of characters who also evolve over time - there are no Heimskr's in Star Citizen. The current mission givers are placeholders for the alpha.

Normally in-game these organising structures, and the personalities in them, are faceless entities you only really have any contact with through lore, they are remote an unchanging, but that is not the plan for Star Citizen. You will see these top tier characters reacting to events in the game universe as well as all the lower tier characters. This is a monumental undertaking and is part of the reason many insist that it will never happen - nevertheless that has been the plan.

If you ever get into a real face to face discussion to talk about such things with the development team (as I have) and ask about this they will take a deep breath and look off and say, there's nothing like it, it's beyond anything ever thought of before but they can't talk details and so get a little lost for words about describing exactly how it is different. it's a fundamentally different approach to the gaming experience. Star Citizen is not a space ship game, it is a life simulator in a fictional universe.

When Chris talks about this plan he describes it like being able to actually live in the fictional universes of the likes of Star Trek or Star Wars.

Star Citizen is going to be the role-players dream game, it is being designed from the ground up to have wide appeal not just to space pilots, it will be fine for casual players, but it's the role players whose minds will be blown. It will be a 24 hour, 7 day a week, 52 weeks of the year evolving experience where there is always something happening and no single player can experience it all, both because you won't have long enough, but also because you can't be logged in 24/7 and you can't be everywhere at once, but you will see it all happening on multiple platforms (mobiles and web) 24 hours per day on the Spectrum. He knows that it will be the social media and content streaming media's dream game because there will always be many new things and events to talk about and show off.

Character slots are about player agency and choice, they aren't primarily about gameplay mechanics. Some are going to become so immersed in the game universe they will appear to not know the difference between the game and their own real lives, because the game with all it's events and characters will seem totally real to them.

Of course it will also be the 'jobbing actor's' dream project too, endless work.

Star Citizen will never be 'finished' in the same sense that other games are finished - with that same fixed experience throughout, it will continue to expand and evolve. This is why in the early days people said Chris Roberts was just plain crazy, yet here we are at the dawn of one the major tech pillars that will make all that possible.

This not just about 'Agent Smithing' or building your own preferred crew. Your characters will die eventually.

Everything is going to be reputation based - more specifically than faction based there will be social status, It's not just ships and weapons. Accessing services and even places you are allowed to go will depend on that mixture of social status, player history and faction reputation.

The political structure of the game will be important, indeed it will set the overall tone for the game. Players will be very aware they are living under a militaristic empire with several social structures and forces that maintain those structures. It's comparable to living in a country with both federal laws and state laws. It will not be allowed for the average player, or indeed lawless players, to easily gain or continue to own and use ships and equipment that can challenge government forces. A few player owned civilian access ships taking down Idrises and Javelins is a temporary Alpha thing.

Many things will change, the security gates will become active, there will be military security checkpoints in certain star systems. In a CitizenCon around 2017 or 2018 Tony Zurovec talked about this, there will be hand held facial recognition scanners, which will also be active at every point of entry and even space stations.

Right now combat is merely opportunistic or a simple mission open to all via a ladder of tiered components and weapons but in the future the 'hunt' part will have tools like engine signature tracking. They do leave clues to their future plans but if you aren't paying attention they are easily missed - like when you are leaving the KRF the guy refers to you as 'civilian' because it is intended that for certain crimes your citizenship can be revoked. If you don't start Squadron 42 with your PU character citizenship will not be easy to get, it is a thing of value with rights and privileges attached. When you get missions for the Advocacy they use the term 'with the relevant experience', currently everyone qualifies, but it won' be that way forever.

The only way you will be able to gain ex-military status is by joining the military, and the only way you can do that is by starting Squadron 42. If you retire your Squadron 42 character to the PU your player history such as training and security clearances go with you. You will have to get to a certain level in Squadron 42 to have the right to own and operate the F8C Lightning for example (in the Squadron 42 Q&A Chris referred to this as a 'badge', notice you don't get the ship free, only the badge), if you don't you won't be able to legally own and operate the F8C in the game in areas controlled by the UEE. The 'rich' (higher level concierge) will get special dispensation to own and operate the F8C because they have demonstrated well above average loyalty to the UEE. This same approach will apply to other tools and features in the game not just ships, weapons and components.

During the CitizenCon presentation where Hurston was first revealed Chris talked about these privileged access places when they walked past the Chairman's Club Lounge, he said there will also be clubs for ex-military personnel, certain mission types and things you can acquire etc will be locked behind those secured access doors.

Your reputation will also affect your ability to use the AI to assist you. There is to be a UEE wide security database with privileged access only for those the empire trusts.

The current system of no long term consequence to choices (or mistakes) you make will not last, once you have a criminal record it stays even after you have served your time. It won't just be the availability of ships, weapons and components that will be a factor - some things will only be legal to own and use according to your status. Supplying equipment and services to those not entitled to them will be considered a crime. You may have no criminal record but if you acquired equipment you aren't licensed to own or operate that can be confiscated if you go into areas the UEE controls. Yes, players will have to get used to losing things. This is the reason why there are non-aligned systems, faction systems and UEE aligned systems. It's not just some vague 'colour' that's only of interest to those who want immersion, it will be an integral part of the gameplay experience.

During testing there is no need for this privileged strata of access, it gets in the way of widescale testing, but that will change. Currently we all enjoy automatic citizenship, and assumed ex-military status, in the only UEE aligned system we have access to, but that's only temporary. In the future it's the players choice to live a life of restrictions or not. If you choose to enter the PU with a non-Squadron 42 character you will enter as a civilian with little history and privileges. People ask 'Will we be able to play as alien characters' and CIG staff are always vague about it with the usual answer - 'perhaps eventually'. The reason for this is because if you chose to be a character from a non-UEE aligned system you have no official status within the UEE, you can't even be a civilian. Since the Tevarin war the Tevarin have had a long running political fight with the UEE for legal recognition, there is only 1 Tevarin UEE Senator, you have to be a citizen in order to vote in UEE elections.

In the early days before all that people could talk about was ships Chris was asked what the game universe will be like - he said it would be similar to the Roman Empire during it's decline. It is a time of almost constant wars on the borders. There will be competing political factions fighting against the UEE with all the secrecy and intrigue that brings, there will be elitism, extreme poverty, there will be lawlessness, slavery and racism, there will be both population control and flow of resources control. The empire will be trying to maintain it's grip on what it controls. Expect a lot of propaganda and rules to follow, with harsh punishment for those that don't follow the rules. "Service Guarantees Citizenship".

Acquiring 'things' is not the endgame - your status within the game universe is to be the driving factor. The ultimate endgame Chris Roberts envisions is for people to live a life of renown and have experiences they will remember.

You see what I mean? The percentage numbers are not important they are just educated guesses, the scale factors and motivations are what is important.

Let's say for example: The game universe is only Pyro and Stanton. No new activities are added. Pyro is 3 times the size of the Stanton system in volume.

Stanton: There are 4 planets with landing zones and an average of 10 outposts each, 6 rivers and 12 caves on each rocky planet (2), 12 moons with average 5 outposts, 6 caves. 19 space stations, 1 asteroid base. 1 Jump Gate.

There's no point in counting the vast open space because once someone is out there the chances of an encounter are nil. Miners will go to the Aaron Halo - which is huge. Once they are out there the chances of being found are virtually zero.

Pyro: Have to be conservative here because we don't know exactly - 6 planets with 8 outposts each, 6 moons average 5 outposts, average of 3 rivers and 4 caves. 6 space stations. 1 Ruin Station base. 1 Jump Gate.

That's 361 POI's for Stanton and Pyro combined - where players could go.

So you tell me what you estimate each group of players is doing in a 24 hour day of play:

How many players per shard per 24 hours? .....

How long is the average play time per player? ..... hours

How many players will multicrew in a ship with 4 players? ....

How many players will multicrew in a ship with 3 players? ....

How many players will multicrew with 2 players? ....

How many players will be solo piloting their ships? .....

What ratio of lawful players to unlawful players will there be? ..../.....

What is the ratio of new players who haven't learnt evasion skills versus those experienced players who have? ..../.....

How many will stay in 'no fire zones' in main planet landing zones, in their own hangars or habs or going shopping etc? ....

How long will players spend in planetary landing zones? ....

How many will be out on planetary or moon outposts in no fire zones? ....

How long will players stay in no fire zones at outposts? .... minutes

How long will players going between outposts be in space between those outposts? .... minutes

How many will be going racing competing or spectating? ....

How long will they spend racing /at the races? ....

How many will be going mining? ...

How long will those miners be out in deep space mining? ..... minutes

How long will those miners be in open space near POI's or between POI's? .... minutes

How many will go do salvaging? ....

How long will they spend salvaging?.... minutes

How long will the players doing salvaging be in open space between POI's? ... minutes

How many players will be doing trading runs? (they can buy from miners and salvagers out in space so that they don't have to come in to POI's) ....

How long will traders spend in space between POI''s? .....minutes

How long will traders spend in no fire zones buying or selling cargo? ..... minutes

How many are going to go do cave missions? .....

How long will those going into caves spend in those caves? .... minutes

How many are going to spend their play time on a river or other open water? .....

How long will it take players to go from their hangar to get to the river or open water? .... minutes

How many are going to go hunting / trekking / camping away from landing zones or outposts? ....

How long will they spend in open space getting from their hangar to those places on planets they find fun to explore? ....minutes

How many are going to be out in deep space exploring? .....

How long are they going to be out exploring deep space? ..... minutes

How long around space stations or exiting a planet before they jump to QT to go exploring deep space? .... minutes

How many players will bed log in and out far away from all POI's? .....

How long will unlawful players spend getting supplies and be visiting points of interest? ..... minutes

How long will unlawful players wait for a victim in any location? .... minutes

How long will unlawful players spend fighting with the victim and transferring the loot? .... minutes

How long will unlawful players spend travelling between their base and where they plan to catch their victims? .... minutes

How long will unlawful players spend in custody? .... minutes

How long will unlawful players spend evading law enforcement? ....minutes

What ratio of lawful players will evade an attack by an unlawful player once an encounter occurs? ...../.....

What ratio of NPC / player encounters does an unlawful player expect to have? ..../....

These are all scale factors and this list is not exhaustive, for every activity or new POI CIG adds the ratio of players in open areas where they are vulnerable and have anything worth taking goes down, especially if they put those activities in safe zones. The majority of the ones I've listed reduce your chances of a successful encounter, CIG only have to change a few variables to affect those scale factors by a significant margin. Players only have to learn a few basic skills or behaviours to significantly reduce the chances of an encounter, like staying out of the populated trade lanes or watching the comms for any reported pirate activity and avoiding that area. Once a pirate shows themselves they are vulnerable to security forces and bounty hunters. Once a pirate haunt is discovered the pirate is now vulnerable to reprisal attacks. There's more but word count won't allow.

While I applaud your attempt at detail and collecting some information, I know the effort that goes into a post that long, you are at least bearing in mind some future plans. The big sigh and facepalm this post deserves is still incoming...

Star Citizen is not merely a conflict-centric game, it will have it, but not in the volume people think it will have it. The game is sensitive to what is happening and where. Threat levels will be constantly monitored. Since the advent of procedural planetary tech it isn't even going to be a primarily space ship game. Those who think it is need to get up to date, it's not 2014 anymore. The way they are building it is so that it can be ALL games in one game, as such it will draw in players from all game genres. The majority will unlikely be interested in an us versus them type game.

Those who do want aggressive type gameplay will fall into two categories:

Those who want to live outside the law - with all the disadvantages and consequences that will bring, it won't be easy.

Those who like the aggressive type gameplay but don't want the punishment of lawlessness consequences, they will act on the side of the law enforcers.

Now it's just a game of numbers which CIG can balance:

75% want a peaceful life doing their thing - farming simulator, miners, salvagers, race drivers, engine tuners, those who want the wild outdoors Cabellas Deer Hunter type experience, the explorers, the Uber drivers and pizza box delivery, the shipping magnate who owns a fleet, the Genesis Starliner owner who wants a lucrative regular route, the wannabe trillionaire playboy in his mansion with lots of servants, the sports players etc. If there are far more varied activities that don't involve going around shooting at people then that is what will draw the players in that direction.

15% decide they like the shooty-type stuff but don't like spending all their time running and hiding or on Quarterdeck Prison planet, they like having access to top of the line frontline mil-spec equipment that needs a good rep with the UEE and full citizenship - so they'll get their work from the Advocacy, which again requires a spotless reputation, and get their pew pew jollies in Squadron 42 as well building up their security clearances to get the really interesting UEE and Advocacy contracts. You understand that CIG owns the bank? They can offer unlimited bounties if they want to, and they'll just keep upping the rewards until they get the balance they want.

10% decide they are going to play on the lawless side but at least half of them are sick of the hassle so they are just gonna play the shady and be drug pushers, fences, suppliers to naughty boys for a big mark-up. Finding all the backdoors and skulking around avoiding the boys in blue. Scrupulously avoiding anything that could destroy their spotless reputation as much as possible.

5% want Jack Sparrow action no matter what it takes, so some of the time they are going after the lawful players, some of the time they are fighting the lawful players that are hunting them down and the other 90% of the time they are running and hiding, trying to find resources they can't get from legal supplies at prices they struggle to afford - no insurance, no bank loans. They don't care that they can't attend any big events like Murray Cup Racing, or the IAE - yeah yeah.. they know that a few days in the pokey won't wipe their reputation clean anymore like the good old days but they'll put up with that. Piracy is one-dimensional boring and repetitive gameplay, you can go off and do other things some of the time if you're really clever, or you have an alt account, but for every minute you're not doing piracy - you don't exist as a problem.

So you play for 4 hours 5 days a week with a group of 5 of you, you're 'on target' doing your pirate stuff for around 25% of that time that's 1 hour a day and it takes 20 minutes per event, you've got to make it profitable you can't just shoot'n'scoot, that means your victims are 3 per 4 hour day - 90% of them are NPC's that means an average of 0.3 players getting your little groups 'special' attention per day. It's hardly a terrifying statistic is it? The average player will have no encounter with you for 99.7% of the time.

Now factor in that a massive population of NPC's is going to dilute all the above populations to the point they are but a tiny minority each in their own sea of activity that is this diverse game universe. 90% is just an average, the game will be populated according to what is happening and where, if there's 2 players in the city of Prime they won't populate it with 18 NPC's. The more lucrative, entertaining and strategically important to the UEE's flow of goods the larger the NPC population.

..and of course the final big one - SPACE IS MASSIVE, NO - LIKE, REALLY REALLY MASSIVE. Anybody with 2 functioning brain cells will learn how to sidestep the trouble spots pretty quick. If you're avoiding the high security populated areas as is only sensible you'll have to wait around for hours in some places before you come across anybody and most of the time that 'anybody' is going to be an NPC. Each 'anybody' you interfere with is potentially going to ramp up your bounty to the point that now the 'anybody' isn't some random player or NPC, it's a group of bounty hunters who've laid a nice juicy looking trap for tired old, bored old you that is nothing but a satisfying payday for them before they head off to that tropical island getaway where they have to go through 10 security checkpoints and 3 military checkpoints to get to, or the winter sports wonderland, to enjoy the fruits of their labour. You get prison or if you're lucky you get to slink off to some rundown space station in the middle of nowhere-ville.

The impression 'pirates' give is of brainless grinning simpletons who can't do basic mathematics, or pay attention and use their imaginations to think ahead. They walk through all the current security checkpoints that aren't activated and don't think - huh maybe one day they will be active. They have no idea what this project is going to become - it's a massive fully immersed as true to life as it gets simulator, with a militaristic political structure.

The very very few who don't fall into that category of grinning simpletons with itchy trigger fingers might make a go of being a pirate, but there will be precious few of them, and they will have the brains not to hang around too long in areas that are distinctly hostile to them. They'll go off and dreamily remember what fun it was when the whole game universe was the size of a goldfish bowl with no security to speak of and no long term consequences - and even then the majority of players never noticed they were there.

Those who think they can bring a few friends might get away with it a couple of times, but each time the force sent to deal with them will get bigger and bigger - because unlike the deluded grinners the game can bring an endless supply of resources depending on how much trouble they think you are. If you're barely a flea bite on a cats behind why should anybody care about you? If they see you once a year and your sorry 'civilian only second-hand scavenged repair job' ship can't do much but drag it's ass while most players figured out if I at least start Squadron 42 and keep my Citizenship and reputation clean I can get all the best gear. You do know that citizenship is revoked when you have a criminal record? The UEE won't trust just anybody with equipment that can challenge it's frontline security forces, don't rely on those ASOP terminals, they're only for the law abiding. Next time you're in Klescher pay attention to what the man is saying as you leave, he refers to you as 'civilian' not citizen.

So because - again - we have the PvE v PvP argument brought up, yet again ignoring the known facts of the case I'm sorry but you get a Picard AND this...

But it's all good fun and nobody wants a completely boring life do they?

They won't have separate servers for anybody.. because.. there's absolutely no need for them. CIG have the powers of a god in this game, they can close jump gates, increase security where-ever and whenever they wish, cause natural disasters, famines and shortages. Even pirates gotta eat.

There is a clean up system - it's called the Density Manager - of course it depends how high the tolerance is set for density of the entities, which is something they will tweak over time. It also allows other gameplay elements to come in and help solve the problem like full ship salvaging, janitors, tractor beam technology and even player missions to collect junk and take it to the incinerator. Some say isn't it terrible that gowns are left all over the place - no it isn't terrible it makes the place more unique and gives a sense of character. A run down place has it's character, a well maintained and pristine place has it's character it's just that players aren't used to it, they are used to games loading a set pristine 'stock' play space. CIG, by not using a standard 'solve problem' script are signalling their future intent toward the game universe as a whole.

Do we need full persistence?

We do if we want the most realistic immersive experience possible. Especially for the experience of calling a place in the game universe 'home'. Or base building. Even the engaging occupation of simply managing all your assets to suit your activities relies on persistence. A player can stamp their character on that part of the game universe in ways not usually open to gamers, whether they intend it or not. If someone is messy, lazy and disorganised in real life they may well exhibit those same characteristics in the game. How many games are there were you can hire a house maid? How many games are there were a player can offer a house maid service? The plan is to physicalise everything, the inventory system will not continue in it's current form, it's just placeholder technology for now.

We do if we want to prioritise player agency over purely scripted activity. How would players create missions and activities for other players without full persistence? Sure more capabilities and player tools would be required, but once you have the core tech there is so much that falls out of it for not much more work, in some cases no dev work at all. Chris is all about player agency and players creating content for other players in this vast expansive game universe, expect more of it to come. Don't under-estimate how many game players out there there are who want to role-play just about anything. Star Citizen aims to be a life simulator, not just a space ship game, if a player wants to role play a Feng Shui expert for player homes, they can. The amount of player agency is what sets this game apart from other vast expanse open world games, with it there is a sense of place and history, a sense of ownership and belonging.

Persistence is not limited to player activity, it extends to the NPC AI population too which allows an ever-evolving game universe, somewhat unique in the massive open world game genre experience. A massive NPC population that doesn't just respond to player activity, it also responds to itself. It achieves what so few other massive open world games don't, it makes the game universe seem alive with activity. More real.

There are those who somewhat short-sightedly insist that Star Citizen will have niche appeal only to pilots, pew pew merchants and mercenary types. They don't understand what is coming so they cannot fathom the idea that eventually the players who don't want to fly a ship, carry a gun or kill anyone will out-number those that do. That is the game universe full persistence and full physicalisation allows. When the wider gaming world finally understands what this project is all about it will draw in players from all game genre types. There will be new game genres that people haven't even thought of yet.

...and how many other game promo's misrepresent the capabilities of their game with marketing material, promising a future experience rather than the current iteration? This is not new in the industry, it's standard practise. Watch the Carrack commercial we know we won't have rock and rope climbing for a long time yet. It's aspirational not descriptive.

This is the sad truth of life, it's always a possibility and other games are not immune to the same effect. How many avid GTA fans will not make it to see GTA VI released? When I decided to support this project I knew my support will benefit future gamers more than it will me either directly or indirectly through longer term changes in the way future games are made.

I worked in the field of medical research prior to becoming a registered nurse and that discipline is well aware that the testing time from a new discovery of a treatment to the time it becomes available has this sad reality - some who could have benefited won't live to see it available as a treatment option, but there is no other safe choice than to follow protocol, which takes years. There are some very exciting developments currently in the field of medical research, particularly with regard to degenerative diseases, spinal cord injury and aging, which are going to change things dramatically in the next 10 to 20 years, by which time I'll be in my 70's and 80's - if I live that long.

Everyone at CIG are well aware of this and CIG customer services have shown some impressive levels of compassion toward those struggling with difficulties over the years.

Can't imagine what you're doing for that to happen, I rarely encounter anyone who shoots at me, and it's even rarer for them to actually kill me before I get away. Often I'll take all my guns and missiles off the ship. I can count on the fingers of one hand the number of times a player has killed me in the last year.

Methinks you could spend some productive time learning better tactics.

Here's a little tip or two, just the basics:

If you come out of a long QT run you'll have a long time to wait until your QT drive spools up again. Come out of QT 'early' before your destination by holding B. Practise until you can get to around 50K km from the POI destination, wait out the cool down and now when you do jump to the destination that you want your drive will be cooled down in a jiffy ready to jump out if there's trouble, don't wait to find out if the ships around you are hostile, just jump - anywhere pick the closest marker to your reticle, you can cancel it. Avoid the 'popular destinations' as much as you can.

If you get dragged out of QT, go to full boost to get to max speed as fast as possible, and decouple, head away from where the radar contacts are - go in a straight line. Once decoupled and at max speed turn and face the 'baddie', fire your missiles at him if he's within range and hitting you. He can't use his flares or noise effectively while he's coming at you and the closing rate between your missiles and him is higher than any weapons he sends your way, he has to turn away to avoid your weapons which means it's unlikely he will catch you up.. you can use your flares and noise without having to turn. If he is landing hits keep your ship spinning so that no shield takes the full force and goes down to nothing, don't touch the throttle (or W key) while spinning. Remember you're in decoupled mode, just let the ship go along the line you chose to get away, every time your nose comes round to face him just punch his nose again. If there are a few of them and the chase lasts long enough they'll have to line up behind each other, there's no other way they can overtake you.

Don't have power sent to things you don't intend to use and get yourself a fast recharging shield before anything else. Engines and shields on the power triangle. If you're already at max speed and coasting on decoipled mode push all power to the shields.

Don't fly in space in coupled mode it's wasteful and limiting.

If you are approaching a landing pad at an outpost on a planet or moon go decoupled if you aren't already, use the TVi to aim for the outpost don't go lower than 10K altitude until you are right over the outpost (point your nose at the horizon beyond the outpost to stop from descending), have your drive spooled and nose pointed at a QT marker and calibrated as you go down. If there's someone there just hold B and jump out. If you're too low to QT boost burn back to altitude as fast as you can and then jump out.

Don't dawdle around POI's get into the 'no fire' zone ASAP. You'll come out of QT usually around 22km out, boost to max speed toward the station use the TVi to make sure you aren't going to hit it. Once the no fire zone indicator comes on spin your ship 180 to face the aTVi and boost burn to slow down until you are slow enough to approach the hangar / pad.

When choosing the next ship to get go for the fastest you can afford, then the one with the most shield faces, then the one with the fastest QT cool down time.

Practise practise practise. The majority of the time these simple techniques should keep you out of trouble or get you out of trouble.

Hope that helps.

You do know the ground vehicle physics is currently being reworked for an upcoming patch? They've been using the basic vehicle CryEngine / Lumberyard physics and control set up to now from what I understand. They did mention the rework in a recent video. Vehicles don't have thrusters and ship engines so 'no IFCS', (actually ship main engines aren't enabled yet iirc, the engine nacelle burn is for show, we fly on thrusters, could check by turning off all the thrusters and seeing if you can move).

The time in development is not really relevant, priorities are. What should they prioritise among all the competing calls from the community? Or should they just work through it all with their own overall plan in mind? What's the point in critiquing a game known to be in an unfinished state (we do have the Issue Council).. you want to give Chris another chance to say.. "No shit, we know it isn't in yet". Accurate mass hasn't been enabled for anything yet, we're still awaiting the full cargo refactor.

Vehicles are working well enough right now to keep the majority happy. Daymar Rally entrants seem fine with what they have currently. They can never please everyone all the time. Some want more content prioritised, some want bug-fixing prioritised, but how many of them realise these two work against each other.

Right now the priority is the core tech pillars, CIG has made that abundantly clear.

So I guess it's a case of 'Duh, no shit Sherlock, hope you had fun doing all that thrashing around proving a known point'.

The current little sleepy backwater Alpha test-bed Stanton system with it's fractious little factions has no idea about the storm that is going to roll through the UEE systems. Go read the history wall of Hurston Dynamics, a major arms manufacturer for the UEE military, there is no mention of the Vanduul war on that wall - yet.

About a year ago now Jared Huckaby told me in person that the Terra Nova system was going to be the first Alpha test system for the PU, but they changed their minds. That's what all the initial work on Terra Prime landing zone and SataBall was all about. That's why there is a huge full wall mural of Terra Prime in the meeting room of the LA office that we've seen on CIG discussion videos, that's why there was a very early video of the first person view of a player running around Terra Prime. They haven't dumped anything, the Terra Nova system will be in the game and all that comes with it, they just changed the communities focus to the Stanton system because what's the point in giving away spoilers for a system they aren't bringing to the players yet?

We also know that they must have expanded the Squadron 42 story line from the 2012 Kickstarter as well because a 2013 stretch goal for 10 'extra star systems' included the Odin system as one of the 10. So why is the Odin system featured in the Squadron 42 vertical slice? Because the story was changed to a time before that Vega II attack to allow us to form an attachment to our character before the main event starts.

You might also notice that every time they show something from Squadron 42 they always show a date and time as well as the location of the events. There are no time jumps in Squadron 42, if you want to get to a star system you have to go through the intervening star system jumps. The route from Stanton to the Odin system goes through Pyro and Nyx. The only landing zone completed to a point where players could use it when they switched from using Terra Nova to the Stanton system was Delamar / Levski and that's why Delamar was put into the wrong star system. You can get to Odin via the same route from Terra through Magus to Stanton.

Star Citizen is not going to be some disconnected multiplayer sandbox tacked on to a single-player game, it is the continuation of the story, and your role in that story if you partook of Squadron 42, you will have an emotional connection to it - to the history, places and characters in it. That's why the level of detail and immersion has to be full on, because the plan is to keep hitting you in 'the feels' again and again throughout the story arc of this game universe. If the attack on Vega II is the equivalent of the Germans going into Poland in 1939 or France in 1940, that directly lead to that speech in the Houses of Parliament, then what's coming next? Admiral Bishop starts his speech by referring to the period of appeasement by the UEE doesn't he? It was Germany going into Poland that prompted the British Empire aligned nations to declare war, which is what Admiral Bishop is doing, so where is that battle of France equivalent going to take place that brings the enemy right up to the gates?

Simple and easy can be done quickly. Those that stick to the tired routine ways of faking it know that well. Bethesda have far more resources than CIG, and their project has been in development for a similar length of time with a barely updated Creation Engine, yet they have opted to stick to the usual cop out mechanics. No manual flying from space to ground, no walking around inside your ship while in flight. No EVA, no boarding, no ship to ship docking, no refuelling (they explained they "have made ships with unlimited fuel because they didn't want players to get frustrated", sounds a lot like one of those "you'd get bored" excuses doesn't it?). Starfield touts that they have 100 star systems - but they only have 4 built cities to visit in those 100 star systems. The cell technology to give the impression that you can land anywhere on a planetary body is just an extension of the cell technology in Skyrim V updated because the hardware is better. Of course what few know is that Bethesda could draw on years of modders doing free work on their engine to demonstrate how to extend it's capability.

You keep comparing this project to other games that don't even come close to the same level of complexity and capability this project has now, and you don't even know what the final version (or Squadron what 42 has) is going to be.

Chris Roberts decided (with the full backing of the community) that we would go for as little faking it as is possible. That's why there was no-one saying "You'd get bored of walking around in, and out of your ships interior after the 10th time."

As you say 90% of the work that the players can see comes at the end, and yet the player has more immersion and capability to just go and do as they please (when it works) now well before that end than most games made by the Fortune 500 Billion dollar companies. It's the most common statement made by new players when they come to the project.

It's not just 2 games either, it's a whole franchise, we know they are building these games with an eye to the future and they have already stated plans to have at least two follow up story campaigns after Episode One of Squadron 42 which will not require a whole remake of the game engine, tools and even in-game assets.

Corporate game companies make games for investors to make a profit - the player experience is secondary. This community and Chris Roberts always puts the player experience first before any other consideration where it is known to be possible. None of the games you mention made by either start up's or existing corporates released a Live multiplayer game to play while it is still being built.

If you want to be so pedantic then CIG did release a game on Dec 23rd 2015 (3 years and 2 months after the company was formed) with around 400 employees and $100 million total revenue, and they haven't charged a penny to existing players (more than they wanted to pay by choice) for all upgrades and addons since. Unlike the makers of No Mans Sky at least they were open and honest about the state of that game release and made people aware of the future plans for it. If you're going to keep giving all those other projects a pass on their 'faking it' lack of scope then you should judge Star Citizen by what it was capable of in Q1 of 2016 because at that time Star Citizen already had capabilities that ED, NMS, KSP2, Flight of the Nova and even Starfield won't have - probably ever.

Simple and easy can be done quickly. Those that stick to the tired routine ways of faking it know that well. Bethesda have far more resources than CIG, and their project has been in development for a similar length of time with a barely updated Creation Engine, yet they have opted to stick to the usual cop out mechanics. No manual flying from space to ground, no walking around inside your ship while in flight. No EVA, no boarding, no ship to ship docking, no refuelling (they explained they "have made ships with unlimited fuel because they didn't want players to get frustrated", sounds a lot like one of those "you'd get bored" excuses doesn't it?). Starfield touts that they have 100 star systems - but they only have 4 built cities to visit in those 100 star systems. The cell technology to give the impression that you can land anywhere on a planetary body is just an extension of the cell technology in Skyrim V updated because the hardware is better. Of course what few know is that Bethesda could draw on years of modders doing free work on their engine to demonstrate how to extend it's capability.

You keep comparing this project to other games that don't even come close to the same level of complexity and capability this project has now, and you don't even know what the final version (or Squadron what 42 has) is going to be.

Chris Roberts decided (with the full backing of the community) that we would go for as little faking it as is possible. That's why there was no-one saying "You'd get bored of walking around in, and out of your ships interior after the 10th time."

As you say 90% of the work that the players can see comes at the end, and yet the player has more immersion and capability to just go and do as they please (when it works) now well before that end than most games made by the Fortune 500 Billion dollar companies. It's the most common statement made by new players when they come to the project.

It's not just 2 games either, it's a whole franchise, we know they are building these games with an eye to the future and they have already stated plans to have at least two follow up story campaigns after Episode One of Squadron 42 which will not require a whole remake of the game engine, tools and even in-game assets.

It is weird isn't it? Some can play fine, some even make video streams about it. When everyone is complaining predicting doom and gloom with no end in sight CIG go on to have a better influx of new players and funds than all previous years... best first quarter ever. In the beginning the ONLY thing we could build was a community of like-minded individuals all willing to work for a common goal.

It's almost as if those that are 'suffering' are in the minority. I played 3.18.2, everything went smoothly except there were no inventories in the shopping terminals. However it seems some did manage to buy and sell things. I managed to get out of the hangars with no issues but some say the ATC system isn't responding.

What do I do when there are issues making the game not worth my time - well, I close the game, hop over to the Issue Council, read some patch reports and either come to Spectrum or Reddit to see if others are having issues I can help with. I watch the output from CIG to see what is currently the focus of the teams or what are the future plans and know - they'll fix it eventually because they usually do.

There are so many variables - some have issues because of their system set up, well it's irritating but usually it can be fixed, or at least explained. Some have Issues because they expect the game to be in a playable state while it is being built - at all times - and can't cope with the idea that something unique and bigger than anything that has come before might need time to mature - it is being built before our very eyes. It's all part of a process that everyone can't necessarily appreciate on a scale few can even grasp fully. To me that is a good thing, it's exactly where I expect it to be.

The day they say it is done there are no more dreams of 'more to come', and that would be a sad ending in my view. Small and temporary inconveniences are deal breakers for some, for others the process is all part of the journey that makes the destination all more worthwhile. In truth, for me there is nothing in the game currently that makes it all worthwhile except to see that process lead to somewhere I can experience something so unique there is nothing else like it. Some say sarcastically "Well our children and grandchildren can enjoy the game even if we can't".. and yes, that is exactly the point, which other projects can you say that about?

Easy can be done tomorrow, easy is what the men in suits invest in for profit at the gamers expense. Easy is consumed and forgotten in a barely a few months. Easy doesn't need passion, communication and participation. Easy limits everyone's horizons. Monumental and ground breaking takes a community of like-minded people to grit their teeth and say, we'll just keep pushing until we get there. That's the amazing thing about being part of a community, when we get tired, impatient, feel dejected or even too frustrated and angry to carry on there is always someone ready to pick up the torch and carry on until we're ready again to get back into the fight. Every brick, screw and nail is another step toward that impossible dream that everyone kept saying would never happen.

If all someone needs is 'a game' there are plenty out there. We can never have that same deep emotional connection to any other game. This project has always been about pushing the boundaries, changing the paradigm - daring to dream bigger and do better in partnership with those that can make it happen, just for the joy of making it happen. One day you'll say with pride, I was a part of that impossible dream. I was there to help make it happen. We aren't just making a game (or two) we're changing the worlds perception about what is not possible and what is achievable if we have the collective will to do it. No-one ever said it was going to be easy. Be honest with yourself, is quick and easy what you really want from this experience?

Sadly as usual the points included do not even reference the large NPC population that will inhabit the Star Citizen game universe. There is also no mention of how detailed and all-encompassing the player reputation and history logs will be. You also neglected to inform the Chat GPT AI that there is a societal structure in the Star Citizen universe, where you go and what you can do will be dependent on your social status and security status - Citizenship, even if you have earned it or bought it, can be revoked by the UEE for lawless behaviour. There are prison sentences, and eventually there will be a prison planet, so expect longer punishments compared to now. Unlike now a criminal record, even though you have served your time, will persist.

Part of the reason the current game universe seems like a free-for-all wild west is because many of the systems are not yet in, and because of CIG's reluctance to be overly punitive, also there is no permanency to a players actions - if a player knows their record will be permanent, they are likely to be more cautious in their actions. They won't be able to access insurance / replacements as easily as lawful players. Player who have Squadron 42 and retire that Squadron 42 character to the verse will have more privileges like access to mil-spec equipment and material, and because of their higher security rating also certain locations and mission types will be restricted to only them. When you accept security missions from the Advocacy in the game now there is no restrictions even though the mission description refers to 'those with the relevant experience', this will be different in the future.

The game is about finite resources, managing those resources to progress toward the goal an individual has set for themselves. The NPC's will be a drain on the lawless player, whether they think they can identify between a player or NPC's or not is irrelevant. Secure systems will have security NPC's and they have infinite resources, which will respond to the level of crime reported in an area. Large herds of wildebeest still roam the African Savannah, and large herds of Carribou still roam northern Canada, Russia and Europe even though there are predators that hunt both those species - the percentage chance that any individual herding beast being attacked is very low. At range a player will not be able to distinguish between players and NPC ships and those same NPC's will use POI to POI route finding which a player can choose not to - the game space is huge, the chances of encounter outside of those trade routes are very very small. Which action seeking pirate is going to wait around for hours in the middle of nowhere on the off-chance of seeing a player?

There will be an up-to-the-minute security status warning system in place so that lawful players wishing to engage in their chosen activity can choose to go to a location or not based upon that information

The game will also have static security checkpoints to get around like the ones players just walk through because they are not functioning, there will be more, unlawful players will have to spend time and resources to get around those checkpoints - any time and resources spent dealing with NPC's and methods to circumvent security checkpoints is time and resources away from interfering with players.

Those players who simply like the PvP action can also play in support of security forces as bounty hunters, and while they can move about freely and can call on NPC resources the lawless player will not have those same benefits. They can chase lawless players around and the hunters become the hunted.

The game universe will have organised events - like Murray Cup Racing, IAE and ILW to name but a few. Lawless players will also be restricted in where they go - the Helios system for example has a paradise holiday planet, but Helios is also heavily secured as a UEE military outpost.

It is about striking a balance, and there will be 'game masters' monitoring everything going on in the game universe - if the balance is too far one way or the other they have many tools to redress that imbalance, they can close Jump Gates, increase security, restrict the flow of resources. They can even cause local natural disasters.

The economy will react to events in the game, if lack of security makes goods and services too expensive that will be dealt with. The UEEN will protect strategic resources as it feels it is required.There should never be a zero-risk scenario for any player whatever activity they choose to engage in, using your intelligence and wit to survive in such an environment is all part of the fun of life in the Star Citizen universe.

When all the systems are finally in place many who think they will have a high old time being the poacher will realise it is easier, more profitable and less restricting to become the gamekeeper - for every defection from the lawless camp that means double the security for the lawful player. Only the very dedicated will continue a lawless life. I very very rarely get attacked in the game now, and security right now is the worst it is ever going to be.

So, you think they should stop adding things now and just bugfix?

Animals will hunt other species to the edge of extinction given the opportunity however since predators are generally not omnivores if the 'food' population declines then so does the predator population - ergo balance is struck. There is a difference between full extinction and near extinction, also I did say 'just about' - I didn't say humans were the 'only species' that might hunt prey to extinction.

Uh huh.. interesting reasoning.

Well to be fair humans are just about the only species that will hunt other species to extinction, however to say 'humans are the only species that matter' is a bit misleading because in order to survive - have something to eat - then other species must survive and prosper.

There has to be a balanced eco-system. Is it the suggestion that 'Alpha Pirates' should farm traders, miners, salvagers etc in order to feed on them? I'd be interested to see the 'alpha's' describe how that farm system would work. Because the best analogy I could come up with that allows a continuous flow of victims would be vampirism. If piracy is too big of a problem then the 'alpha's' are left with nought but cannibalism - I doubt anyone would shed a tear about that.

Of course these pirates always completely forget about the NPC population.

If the victims also have brains, eyes, a fast set of legs, armour, teeth and claws it isn't always so one sided. Just because someone chooses a non-violent pastime doesn't mean they aren't perfectly capable of defending themselves when the need arises... so the term 'Alpha' is somewhat subjective. If you put a hungry Cheetah in a ring with a full grown bull elephant - my money's on the elephant.

This is an interesting bug / problem because it gives us clues about the process by which things are brought into the game universe.

Prior to any form of global persistence we had player persistence first - what you had equipped the last time you logged out should be on you when you log back in, logging out caused the DGS to record your last state to a database, so you are stowed. Then we had shipboard persistence, anything stowed aboard ship came back when you logged out/in again and brought your ship back to the pad. But if your ship was unstowed then you had to claim it via insurance and so lost it's contents because the server had no function to record it's state outside of a hangar, until bed logging.

A player is a collection of items to load into the game - first come 'the bones' that allow you to move and do stuff - they are invisible. Next, attached to those bones are a 3D model (mesh) of your body - one for your body and one for your head. That body and head are parented to your bones (the bones are the parent and the body meshes are attached to the bones). Next any gear you have is attached first, flight suit or clothes, the helmet chest armour and arm and leg armour are attached to the flight suit, the armour pieces have attachment points for other equipment. Your head has the HUD element attached to it. The helmet also has a HUD element attached to it.

The way it used to work is that a server was spun up with a pristine level designer made version of the Stanton system and every Stanton system on every server was identical. Once that was loaded onto a server other services would then load in other elements like NPC's from the NPC scheduler service and players (from some service I can't remember the name of so I'll just call it the player item attribution service). Player items include you (your avatar) and anything attributed to you on your RSI Hangar page. Anything not attached to you goes in the local parent inventory.

The Dedicated Game Server running the game would update your record of where you are and what you have in the game to a database if you stowed those player items before log out - which means making a hard copy record of where they were and what they were attached to. When the player loads into a landing zone you are attached to that entity which is the landing zone which is attached to the planet which is attached to the game universe entity. This is what is called Object Containers. As long as there is a record of you being present in an object container on a database the DGS can access then that data can be retrieved the next time you log in, if there is no record, then there is nothing to attach you to and you are 'unstowed'.

We are seeing lot's of evidence of network errors that are either not making entries to databases (like PES) or perhaps corrupted entries to databases. But the network issues also cause slowdown of retrieval of information that IS present on databases. We see this most commonly as control input to reaction time lag, inventory lag etc. So it's all part of the same problem.

They've switched from static databases that are updated from running DGS's to the constantly running persistence database which is currently being fed from multiple instances of the Stanton system at once - hundreds of them, perhaps even more. There is a temporary 'patch fix' service running on the DGS feeding data to and from the PES service. That patch fix seems to because issues with the network stack queue between the DGS, PES and the player clients, and other services. The change to the way we get our ships now is a fix to reduce the network traffic caused by players claiming ships at multiple locations, many at a time for those who have fleets of them.

The fix where you load into a non-game-universe standalone module to refresh the database holding your player items suggests if it works then it wasn't just network slowdown that threw up the 'player unstowed' problem... but the long load time to get into the game once you tried the fixes says there is network slowdown of retrieval of player attributed data as well, which would fit because we're seeing evidence of DGS to backend service network slowdown all over the place, and the only answer to network slowdown is the same as it used to be on dial up networking in the 1990's - all you can do is wait and hope.

The fully persistent universe they have planned includes the persistence database, but also the Replication Layer Gateway Service through which all input services feed information to running server shards and PES simultaneously. The persistence database is in but the Replication Layer isn't yet. When it does go in then each DGS will report to that persistently running service so that each server isn't making entries to the PES database individually. which should / will improve matters significantly.

sigh - please show me another game that has something similar to what Cloud imperium Games are calling The Replication Layer Gateway Service - Replication Layer for short.

If you read the information from CIG they put out about how they plan to implement full persistence and server meshing you'll see a graphic, it is a map of how the services connect to each other. You'll see that game clients will connect to the Replication Layer, the Replication Layer then connects to the DGS shards and the persistence database - there is no direct connection between player clients and DGS shards. The Replication Layer Gateway Service has a function to synchronise the 'state' of the DGS's and the Persistence database and then replicate that state to each individual connected game client.

The Replication Layer Gateway Service is not yet implemented - but PES is - parts of it's function are still running on each individual DGS shard which means multiple DGS's are trying to synchronise with the persistence database - and they are getting out of sync. The persistence database started running when 3.18.0 went live and continued running until they reset it with 3.18.1. No DGS shards run continuously - none of them. That global synchronisation function will be broken off the DGS build and taken over by the Replication Layer Gateway Service which will also run continuously.

Read the output from the dev's regarding the issues with 3.18.0 - they don't talk about server performance or tick rates, they do talk about databases, services and network, and they actually use the term 'out of sync'.

The problem is more that there is a service missing, a function that is currently running on the individual DGS's - The Replication Layer Gateway Service. Once that goes in it's job is to keep everything in sync rather than multiple DGS's trying to keep everything in sync. That function will be taken off the DGS build.

Relating Star Citizen to the way other multiplayer games work is of no use, Star Citizen doesn't work like other multiplayer games. I'm well aware that the way networked multiplayer games work is written in stone, but CIG threw those stones away and re-wrote the book.

The answer is yes and no. They can do things which improve the backend service network performance - and they have - but yes Server Meshing will alleviate that network strain even more because servers that only hold a small part of the game world don't need to update all the change states of entities in that game world, only the one's that are in that local area of the game world.

The reason this problem showed up was because currently all shards hold multiple versions of the Stanton system, when server meshing goes in there won't be so man multiple versions of the game world running simultaneously.

It does, but those effects are in the few milliseconds, not many seconds or even minutes.

An example:
Players were reporting that they requested ATC and the hangar doors appeared to open, so the player flies in because the DGS told them the ATC command was granted and the doors are open - but when the DGS queries the persistence database it says the hangar doors were not open the ship hit the doors and was destroyed - so the player may even have reached the landing pad before the PES updated DGS says - your ship hit the doors and exploded. That's how badly out of sync the DGS's were getting with the backend services.

If that were due to DGS tick rate then that server tick rate would have to have been at multiple thousands of milliseconds per tick.

I have been telling people for a while now what causes interaction delay and 'change state' delay, and no it doesn't have anything (much) to do with server tick rate. It's because of delay in network traffic between the player client and server, server and backend services (like the PES set of services), then network back out to connected player clients.

There are only a small number of movement controls that are directly controlled by the player (input commands), most player inputs which are 'change state requests' go up to the server first, get collected, sorted and sent to the backend services then the results of those 'change states' are sent out to each connected client by the server simultaneously so hopefully all players see those change state events at the same time. Change state events are terminals, doors open/close, hangar doors, ATC requests, weapon customisation, player gear changes equip/unequip, elevators and loot boxes etc.

People say 'this thing is not working!' like calling ATC, or getting out of your chair, or getting out of bed, , turning ships lights on, or even the delay in an NPC realising the player is there or missions not completing - they may or may not be bugged but those of us who wait before spamming more commands (because we know why it'a happening) will find that the command does work there is just a variable wait delay before you see the result of your input - this is caused by network delays, not server tick rates. These network delays have been mentioned in dev posts and patch notes.

If you've had a 30K you'll know the game becomes unresponsive to most commands because those commands made by player input don't happen client side first, if they did happen client side first we'd all see the results of player actions at different times and as they said the persistence database 'got out of sync' with player activity and that is why it needs resetting, with a 30K they need the network connection to the server which is missing when there is a server crash. They have made a DGS Crash recovery service which uses the persistence database to spin up servers to replace the one that crashed in it's virtually identical state, when they talked about this they said the player may experience periods of game unresponsiveness for a short while until the recovered server shard is spun up and connected to all backend services.

The reason they changed the way ship ordering is done at ASOP terminals when you first log into the game is because players were spawning in for the first time and flying to a space station then requesting all their ships to be transferred to the space station all at once by going down the list (I was guilty of this and I have over 30 ships) - this caused the 'entitlement processing' backend servers to get overloaded with network traffic - which lead to ASOP terminal issues and inventory issues, even player log in flow issues.

Anyone who has been following Elon Musk could work out, every project he has been involved with is about that colony on Mars. Can't have ICE powered cars on Mars. The hyperloop is fairly pointless and impractical on Earth, but it would be perfect for Mars. Need better, cheaper solar panels and batteries on Mars. Need a tunnel boring machine on Mars for habitats and underground highways as well as mineral mining, even the robot is about Mars. Starlink is a double-plus, they can use it on Mars too but it also has the advantage on Earth that no government or pesky human can interfere with the information flow - cables are vulnerable, constellations of satellites aren't as easily taken out, and we know how he feels about governments and their oversight. He isn't the biggest fan of 'democracy in action'. Notice he isn't interested in anything that flies in atmosphere except rocket powered engines.

Once they reach the asteroid belt there's gold aplenty in them thar hills. Way more than there is down on this ball of rock and it isn't locked up with private land owners or governments. Once they get there it's easier to extract, it's getting there and staying long enough to start operations that is the issue. Once they do though they don't need anything from Earth anymore except warm bodies for a while. Plenty of rare Earth minerals out there and no restrictions on nuclear power with unlimited cloudless sunlight.

He mooted the idea of taking fissile radioactive material to Mars, all the internet nerds laughed at the idea because they assumed he thought about spreading it over the surface. But it's more likely he'd tunnel under the polar ice cap and dump it down the very deep hole. It would heat the surrounding rock if there was enough of it, the outcome would be to melt the polar ice - which is mainly CO2 and water - thickening the atmosphere, but if the sub-surface rock did melt the heavy radio-active material would sink down further into the core - again big 'if' there was enough to make the core rotate again then Mars has a magnetosphere perhaps enough to stop atmospheric loss into space (a thicker atmosphere would reduce cosmic radiation too) and reduce solar radiation at the surface. There would have to be a lot of it, but there's plenty out there in the asteroid belt and there may even be some on Mars' surface anyway. It would be many many years, perhaps even hundreds before that plan could work...

I wonder why he's so keen to look into life extending and human capability extending technologies? Of course once you leave Earth there are no laws against stem cell research and cloning for organ harvesting to worry about. All those trillionaires suddenly so mad keen to get into space right now. I recommend people to watch the movie 'Elysium' with Matt Damon and Jodie Foster, very interesting premise.

Interesting guy, one might even say 'He's driven'.

Already coming. It's called The Spectrum and people will see it first in Squadron 42. It's the Star Citizen version of the internet with sports news and shows, entertainment shows and regular news / current events shows like 'Plain Truth' and 'Empire Report'. We've already seen some of the videos for The Spectrum: Galactic Gear, Whitley's Guide, Reunion, the Squadron 42 recruitment video for the first Invictus Launch Week etc.

The Reliant MAKO News Van has cameras and an editing suite so that players can stream in-game events to The Spectrum, and we can see camera drones used in many videos and images they have put out. The first time we saw camera drones was in the Admiral Bishop speech to the UEE Senate video.

What the OP is asking for will come from the TDD (in the game now but not functional), The Spectrum and from interacting with the NPC population. There is also the ARK Repository database in the Tayac system where players can trade information. In the early days of the project they stated repeatedly, the most valuable commodity in Star Citizen will be information.

Of course we all know you exited your ship leaving the thrusters on making it neutrally buoyant (as it's designed to be) on a planet with storm force winds. You can see the thrusters working in the picture.

Wassup? Not used to having that level of immersion in your games?

Turn your engines off before you exit your seat, just like you would any IRL vehicle - simple.

Ah well I suppose it's back to the ED forums Star Citizen thread for you then... byeeee!

We do know the tactics: Major new milestone patch. Upcoming event. Upcoming sale. Let's get in there and piss in the well for any newcomers. When's the hack gaming-rag article coming out? Ask Stuart.. he'll know.

You understand that anything you put into those AI bots is not private. Why would CIG put their proprietary code into something owned by someone else which allows access to anyone?

Are you aware that CIG went to court to stop another company getting access to their game code?

Some of the things people think are bugs are not actually code bugs, they are the system hardware struggling to keep up. Very often when things don't seem to respond in the game or random events happen unexpectedly that is an issue with the network because Star Citizen doesn't work like a standard multiplayer and if people understood that they'd realise a significant amount of those "it doesn't work" events resolve themselves if you just wait until the network catches up.

A lot of the bugs people report are also the result of the deficiency in the players hardware and lack of optimisation of their own PC or internet connection.

Would you like to hear what the people who are making the game code say about 'bugs'?

So why are you here if you found something else to occupy you? This the forum to discuss the game after all.

Some of us are having a perfectly pleasant time in 3.18.1... thank you.
